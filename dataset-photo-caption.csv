The Story
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Once per month during a full moonrise at sunset, rangers on Mt. Tamalpais, just north of San Francisco have a moonlight walk.  This is the only chance to see this place at night because the park closes at sunset.  It was hot (90f (32c), dry and windy above the cold (59F (15c) fog.  You can literally walk from the cold fog to the hot winds and back again in just a few minutes!  And at times, you can feel cool breaths of air breaking up the hot winds.  This situation is common all summer long at 1500-3000 ft elevation above the coast of California.

The grasses, fog and trees, blew a lot and became softened during the 4 minute exposure.  So there is very little here that was stationary.  So even though it is sharp, only the rocks on the trail, the short foreground grasses, and the background are sharp.

If you ever get a change to do this, definitely try it out.  Sometimes the cold fog is too high and you see nothing, but it is worth a try.

See &quot;Guided hikes&quot; here:
<a href=""http://www.mttam.net/"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">www.mttam.net/</a>


The map shows where you park to start the hike.  The exact location is a 2 mile moderate hike in the dark from the ranger station, which is near the gate that they close at sunset.  It is not far from the road that you can take during the day, but a long-ish hike at night.  Bring your flashlight!

This was taken on our final day. We hiked from Moraine Lake to Sentinel Pass and back. Due to time constrains we were not able to go any further. The first part of the hike is strenuous and signs at the start say that it is highly recommended to travel in groups of 4 due to grizzly bear activity in Larch Valley. 

The first part basically goes uphill all the way. It's approx. 1,500 feet elevation sraight up in serpentines. Once you pass the timberline, it all becomes a totally different scenery - and that was the most amazing thing we experienced in the Rockies. All trails and mountains, even though they are so close, are so different. Larch Valley bascially is like a huge plateau surrounded by a huge mountain range. It is also called the Valley of the ten peaks. 7 1/2 peaks are visible in the background. 

It is truly an amazing scenery to hike through. Probably the best hike I have done so far. Photo opportunities are everywhere, which makes sorting out the good ones really tough. The lake just before the last huge elevation gain was still partially frozen. The &quot;trail&quot; goes up on the left side through rocks and snow. 

We met a couple people up there. &quot;Luckily&quot; not everyone makes it that far. 

Elevation at this point is approx. 8,600 feet. 

Photo was taken with one single exposure. 1/160 sec @ f/11

I am a native Coloradoan that found my passion for nature at an early age thanks to beautiful spots like this.  West Creek Falls are just inside Rocky Mountain National Park and also are within the West Creek State Natural Area.  West Creek below the falls serves as habitat for populations of the threatened native greenback cutthroat trout (<i>Onorhychus clarki stomias</i>). 

Image note: a couple of folks in the comments have asked if this is an HDR.  I would say 20% or less of what you see here is HDR and 80% is basically an unretouched original as the base image.  I often find laying an HDR image that is as good as I can get it on the non-hdr middle ev frame and then turning the opacity down on the HDR layer can help keep colors natural and yet still protect highlights and bring out shade details.  Also for the HDR software used on this, it was actually the new Photomatix beta 3.1 version's exposure blending with all the manual controls (try it!) and no tone-mapping was done."

A cherry blossom is the flower of any of several trees of genus Prunus, particularly the Japanese Cherry, Prunus serrulata, which is sometimes called sakura after the Japanese (桜 or 櫻; さくら).[1][2] Many of the varieties that have been cultivated for ornamental use do not produce fruit. Edible cherries generally come from cultivars of the related species Prunus avium and Prunus cerasus.

Varieties and blooming
Japan has a wide variety of cherry blossoms (sakura); well over 200 cultivars can be found there.[17] The most popular variety of cherry blossom in Japan is the Somei Yoshino. Its flowers are nearly pure white, tinged with the palest pink, especially near the stem. They bloom and usually fall within a week, before the leaves come out. Therefore, the trees look nearly white from top to bottom. The variety takes its name from the village of Somei (now part of Toshima in Tokyo). It was developed in the mid- to late-19th century at the end of the Edo period and the beginning of the Meiji period. The Somei Yoshino is so widely associated with cherry blossoms that jidaigeki and other works of fiction often depict the variety in the Edo period or earlier; such depictions are anachronisms.
 
Winter sakura (fuyuzakura/Prunus subhirtella autumnalis) begins to bloom in the fall and continues blooming sporadically throughout the winter. It is said to be a cross between Tokyo Higan cherry (edohiganzakura/P. incisa) and Mamezakura/P. pendula.[18]
 
Other categories include yamazakura, yaezakura, and shidarezakura. The yaezakura have large flowers, thick with rich pink petals. The shidarezakura, or weeping cherry, has branches that fall like those of a weeping willow, bearing cascades of pink flowers.


The Netherlands
 In the year 2000, the Japan Women's Club (JWC) donated 400 cherry blossom trees to the city of Amstelveen. The trees have been planted in the Cherry blossom park in the Amsterdamse Bos. A special detail is that every tree has a name — 200 trees have female Japanese names, 200 trees have female Dutch names.

I shot this on a tripod using mirror lockup and a 2Sec. selftimer. I also used a polarizing filter and adjusted the image in Photoshop CS4 Extended.

It was very cold today and as I was shooting my battery died, I warmed it up in my pocket put it back in and it worked fine. I have a battery grip on my camera, but I only use one battery, would using a second battery increase the battery life of my camera in cold weather?

This is one of the most beautiful spots in the Canadian Rockies. Just head towards Lake Louise and take the exit on the way up. It's approx. a 14km detour (one-way) and not as crowded as Lake Louise. The lake color, again, is fantastic but not as &quot;damp&quot; blue as Lake Louise.

Hiking is great at both lakes. And most surprisingly every hikes gives you a totally different landscape.

We did the Larch Valley and Sentinel Pass hike, which are simply stunning and gorgeous all along the way. On these hikes it is highly recommended to travel in groups of at least four, due to high grizzly bear activity. For those who are not into hiking, you can rent canoes at the lake or just take a walk along the lake shore.

This photo is basically how it came out of the camera. It is as stunning as it looks like. The light is bit harsh but it's hard to mess up a photo taken up there ;).

I hope you enjoy the short series on the Canadian Rockies. Stay tuned ;).

Please view large on black here - it's worth it!

When I shoot seascapes I'm always trying capture the waves and their motion in the most interesting way possible. Rarely do I get a chance to express that goal with such a great visual metaphor. When I saw this sand wave on the beach I laughed out loud. After all, could there be a more absurdly perfect subject for a seascaper?

Post-Processing 
----------------------
In Raw Converter (Nikon Capture NX2)
- Processed single raw file twice, once for the sky and once for the foreground
- Exposure bump because I didn't pay close enough attention to my histogram, d'oh!
- Global curves adjustment to add contrast and pop
- Local contrast adjustments to enhance colors and details in clouds, sand, and rocks

In Photoshop:
- Noise reduction via Neat Image plug-in
- Selective sharpening of the sand and rocks
- Blend in the sky via a gradient mask
- Dodge/Burn on Soft Light layer through various luminosity masks to enhace shine and appearance of sand wave, brighten rocks, and darken overly bright part of the sky
- Levels adjustment on dark luminosity mask to improve contrast in rocks
- Curves layer to brighten foreground and add contrast
- Color balance to remove a teensy bit of magenta from the the foreground

<strong><u>About</u></strong>

This is my 25th upload from our weekend trip to Paris end of october 2008.

Part of the Jeff Koons exhibition in the castle of Versailles, I think many people - just like me and Frank did - start to laugh when they enter this room, it really shows the lunacy of the rulers of that time, they were like little childeren playing and rolling in wealth when their people were living in povetry.

<strong><u>The shot</u></strong>

Single freehand shot in RAW/ISO800 at f/9 using the Sigma 10mm fisheye lens.

<strong><u>Photoshop.</u></strong>

° Crop and free transform to get it dead straight.
° Shadow &amp; highlights.
° Curves.
° Highpass sharpening.

We were sitting on a bench in the shade getting a respite from the unforgiving Arizona desert sun when this little fellow came out of its burrow and stared at us without moving for several minutes. After having decided that we were not a threat, it climbed on this tomatillo bush and began to feed. It allowed me to get fairly near - at least, near enough to get this close-up and a few others.

Tasmania

The Hazards are another of Tasmania’s Icons which I had aimed to get a few shots of. We were running short of time by the time we arrived at Coles Bay on our last day of the trip. In the mid afternoon , the weather was completely gloomy and drizzling. Instead of lugging photographic equipment around, I went jogging up to the Wineglass Bay lookout and on the way down, spotted some clearing on the horizon. Marianne was pessimistic and chose to rest her &amp; the baby bump in our very comfy self contained cottage (Amos house). I this spot with a view of the Hazards just outside of the main street in town. The intermittent rain splashed on the 5dmkII before I put the rain cover on and nearly killed it! Live view disabled, mode changing disabled, iso adjustments disabled, AF disabled – I felt like I was working an old school film camera but at least I got a few shots off before the light disappeared!

Second day on The Faroe Islands, and I all ready made around 500 photos and I still got 10 days left.
I'll see if I can process one or two photos in the next couple of days for you, but I much rather spent the time making new ones.

Today's photo is and HDR from Sweden, I made last year on a weekend trip with the photo club.
I had i hard time getting the blue color just right, one moment is was to bright and colorful, the next a bit to greenish, then magenta.
And now when I look at it on my portable, I think it might be a little to magenta again.

Well, I decided to publish it anyway, so you can tell me what you think about it.

Grizzlies are normally a solitary active animal, but in coastal areas the grizzly congregates alongside streams, lakes, and rivers during the salmon spawn.

Every other year, females (sows) produce one to four young (most commonly two) which are small and weigh only about 500 grams (one pound).  A sow is very protective of her offspring and will attack if she thinks she is being threatened."

I have 972 songs programmed into this little MP3 player, and I have just begin to use it’s hard drive.  I love that I can work out for a week and never hear the same song twice… longer than that actually.  

Once an hour I hear either a Rush or an R.E.M. song… that’s just the volume of their songs in there.  And I love that I have the most random songs in the mix.

<i>OH MY GOODNESS! I'M BACK! I'm aware of the unbearably horrifying place this has been without me and I'm sorry, from the bottom of my heart, for making these last few weeks so hard for you guys. I'm sure you even went so far as to contemplate the end of the world on multiple occasions, but have no fear; I have returned! :P</i>

This shot is inspired by the giant kid that still seems to pervade my entire being -- I've always wanted to 'grow up' quickly in age, maturity, and credibility, but the more I grow into these childhood dreams, the more I wish I could switch directions.

While staying up late, having my own bank account, and making my own decisions comes with many merits, the things from my childhood -- carelessness, freedom, agility (both mental and physical), and the ability to make a billion mistakes that, instead of threatening my livelihood, served as great learning experiences -- that made it so awesome, are fading away.

So while it's great to have kids grow up and develop their own unique places in the world, it's important to ensure the persistence of the saying, &quot;let kids be kids&quot;. Because there will come a day when this girl is no longer willing to plunge into the middle of a skating rink to entertain hundreds of people she's never met before. There will come a day when she has &quot;<i>more important</i>&quot; things to do than spend 30 hours a week perfecting her craft. There will come a day when this girl can no longer physically balance on a single 3mm blade whilst dancing and doing the splits.

Let's hope this day comes later rather than sooner -- but until then, let her be a kid and do all of these things that will someday exist only as memories :)"

4051104262,"I do not know what it is, but something keeps calling me back to this photograph. It is nothing special, a sunset shot taken at Gros Cap, Ontario, just outside of Sault Ste. Marie. This is really the beginning point of the St. Mary’s River, the body of water that connects Lakes Superior to Lake Huron.

But, for a number of reasons, this area holds special meaning to me. It is near the area I grew up, and an area I will always consider “home”, even though I live four hours from its shores now.

The strip of land you can see is part of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. An area equal in beauty, not only geographically beautiful, but home to some of the friendliest and down to Earth people you will ever meet. A portion of the land on the horizon is Point Iroquois.

Point Iroquois is a place where an epic battle took place, that shaped history, and the territorial boundaries that various tribes of the First Nations people held. The Iroquois were one of the most ruthless and relentless tribes. They were fierce warriors, who steadily encroached on other tribe’s territory, driving many tribes from their traditional homelands. They sent a raiding party to the shores of Lake Superior, and were camped out at Point Iroquois. What they were not aware of, was that a warring group of Ojibwa were on the far side of the point. When the Iroquois had settled in for the evening, the Ojibwa encircled their camp, and with a loud war cry, all but a few of the intruders were massacred. A few escaped into the night, but this battle marked the beginning of the end for the Iroquois’ push to take Lake Superior.

A friend of mine lives a few miles up the coast from this area. He was building a camp about ten years ago, and began to excavate the property. As he was clearing the property, his son found a sharp piece of stone that resembled an arrowhead. They continued to clear the property and discovered more and more artifacts on the property and adjoining creek bed. An archaeologist was contacted, and a proper survey and dig was completed. He had 79 different artifacts that were collected from the property. Apparently, the property was a meeting place where tribes from Agawa, met with tribal people from Manitoulin Island and area, to trade goods and hold ceremonies. This would entail travel of close to 300 miles between the two tribes. Chert rock that was used for weaponry and tools at this time was discovered from both areas, this information is what the archaeologist based his discoveries on.

So, yeah, I think it is a pretty neat place, even if the sunset was less than special that evening."

This panorama of Marble Canyon and the Colorado River was constructed using Photoshop Elements to stitch together vertically two landscape-oriented images captured from Navajo Bridge, formerly a vehicular bridge, but now open solely to pedestrian and equestrian traffic.
Here the Colorado River has exited from the bottom of Lake Powell and the Glen Canyon Dam a few miles away on its way to deepening the Grand Canyon, replenishing Lake Mead, generating more hydroelectric power at Hoover Dam and proceeding on its journey from the Rocky Mountains to its final destination at the Gulf of California and the Pacific Ocean. When the constituent images were captured, the Colorado River was missing its signature reddish tint. This was due to the severe drought in the Colorado River basin, and the lack of rain failing to wash the usual reddish silt into the river."

Last Friday, I headed out from my house for my first winter trip to Lake Tahoe, a mere 160 miles from away.  It normally takes about 3 hours so I figured I'd be there for a great stormy sunset.  Well, I left at 10am and was within 30 miles by 1pm.  Unfortunately the freeway traffic was really slow because they required snow tire chains over the Donner Summit even though it was above freezing with no snow on the road.  So the last 30 miles took 4 hours.  Yes, FOUR hours!

I did see an incredible sunset... while inching along in my car.  Aargh!  This photo is from 2 days later.

I stayed at Squaw Valley, elevation 6,400ft (almost 2,000m), home of the 1960 winter Olympics.  It is a very cold valley and by the morning, the car had become encased in over 1 inch of solid ice plus another 8 inches of fresh snow.  I borrowed an ice scraper but I could not make a dent in the ice without possibly breaking the windows.  So I was stuck watching a nice sunrise from the parking lot!  It was 18F that morning (-7c), the coldest I have ever experienced.

After that, the clouds cleared away for the next several days.  But I had to see this place for myself.  So once the ice was gone, I came here.  

Since there were no clouds, I knew I'd have to be a little extra creative to get an interesting shot since I like to have nice clouds in the sky.  Fortunately, there is a brief time after sunset when even on a clear day, the colors turn soft and reddish.  So after hiking around for an hour, I found the most interesting composition I could find as the sun set.  

During the day, these stones normally have only a slight reddish tint to them, but after sunset they almost have an orange-reddish glow.  So I tried my best to make the best photo that I could.

The map shows exactly where this is.  The middle beach at Sand Harbor.

An oldie for today - this was taken from 2/3 of the way up a very steep scree slope heading to the black cuillin ridgeline in southern skye. Down below, the peaceful small loch was one of our favourite places visited in 2010. This shot would have been much better photographed as an exposure blend but at the time I chose to use filters which couldn't hold back the sky enough I think. Hiking back to Glen Brittle in the dark was an experience too! ps. Marianne is just visible if you strain hard to see her down below!

4730563864,"I recently had the opportunity to travel with my sister's family and my mother through Italy, Croatia, and Slovenia. Apart from flights to and from Europe, our trip was done entirely by car (except for an overnight ferry crossing), starting and ending in Rome by circling the Adriatic. We pretty much saw everything we could squeeze in between May 3 and 19 - May 2 &amp; 20 being long flight days - driving and stopping from place to place continuously on many of those days.

Ljubljana, Slovenia, was a welcome stop for us: For the first time since the trip started everyone had their own room! Up to that point we had pretty much shared suites or large single rooms together, and though we all got along great during the trip, it's a serious relief after so long to have a space where you can just relax by yourself, have your own bathroom to hang your wet clothes in and not have to wait for, and especially to not have to wear ear plugs because your mother snores like a pair of asthmatic grizzly bears fighting to the death over a hunk of elk meat. :P

So after we got settled down and separated for the evening, I decided to finally attempt some night photography. I had to leave my work-horse tripod at home (Gitzo 2220 and Markins M10L ballhead) so I brought a <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0002J2TLC"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">little table-top Vanguard tripod</a> I'd bought for the trip. This little tripod was seriously limited compared to my usual rig, but it was able to support the weight of my camera and heavy lens - and it held the camera still, so despite the pain of using it, it did the trick. And having accidentally left behind my filters, lens hoods, and remotes as well, I actually managed fairly well. It was painful at times, though.

Ljubljana (pronounced LeeYOU-blee-AH-na) has a somewhat Old Europe feel with a bit of modern Europe thrown in (which probably describes many European cities these days). The city center where we stayed is part business district, part university student hangout, and part &quot;old town&quot;, and it's pretty, and cleaner than most modern cities I've seen. I was surprised at how active the night life was in this area even on Tuesday night, too, which was very cool since it was a great atmosphere and I certainly felt safer than I have walking alone on dark streets in Manhattan at 11pm.

I eventually settled near one of the many stone bridges that cross the beautiful canal that winds through the city and took this shot.

I looked up and they were flying back and forth between trees in pairs and small groups. The majority of them kept flying into and around one large pine tree, making quite a racket. I thought that there was a kill site near by that they were feeding on. But then I noticed the subject of their interest. 

There was a bald eagle in the tree, and they were trying to drive it out of their territory. I have seen this a number of times with ravens; not only with bald eagles, but also with owls. An eagle could easily kill a single raven, but when you are outnumbered twenty to one, sometimes it is easier to just leave…which he eventually did.

This photo made me wonder, is this the perspective an eagle would see when he was landing in a tree over a river?"

4402011980,"So this is the tenth Photo I dedicate to the new Angels and Airwaves Album which is called Love. 
The title of today’s song is Shove. You should definitely download it here for free: <b>http://modlife.com/angelsandairwaves/love </b>

This is where I live… It’s my castle, I am the King :). You don’t believe me? Me neither. To be honest most of the time I need a shove to go to this place because there is always a lot of work if I go there. This building looks really beautiful, especially in autumn, when this photo was taken but photos often show the beauty of a moment and not reality. Do you yet know what this place could be? I wait for you guess, I really do!
Have a nice day everybody!

--

<b>Shove</b>
Forget the things that you own
And travel almost anywhere you can go
Dance across the tree tips, set them ablaze
Soaking in their pleasant warm summer haze
And weeping on her streets and school city blocks
And finding streams on her while youre skipping rocks
And feeding on her touch as it will barely keep you alive

She said show me the world thats inside your head,
Show me the world that you see yourself, you could use Some help
Cause sometimes it comes with a shove, when you fall in love

It can be so bold and so cavalier
To reach out to the fire her souls sending here
It can be like death that blows like a breeze
Making all ones strength go weak at the knees
I hate to feel the shallow ground giving way
Ive never let myself fall this much astray
And feeding on her touch is all one does to survive

She said show me the world thats inside your head,
Show me the world that you see yourself, you could use Some help
Cause sometimes it comes with a shove, when you fall in love

She said show me the world thats inside your head,
Tell me your secrets of life and death, and your one regret
Cause sometimes it comes with a shove, when you fall in love

She said show me the world thats inside your head,
Show me the world that you see yourself, you could use Some help
Cause sometimes it comes with a shove, when you fall in love

She said show me the world thats inside your head,
Tell me your secrets of life and death, and your one regret
Cause sometimes it comes with a shove, when you fall in love

If youre ever alone, then your heart will know
It can call to mine, and Ill be at your side
If youre ever alone, then your heart will know
It can reach to mine, Ill be at your side

The park was acquired by the State of Delaware in 1976.

The Delaware Division of Parks and Recreation has retained the historic charm of Bellevue while providing many opportunities for recreation. Walking and jogging are popular activities at any time of the year. A 1-1/8 mile fitness track circles a catch-and-release fishing pond stocked with bass, catfish, and sunfish, while the nearby exercise trail offers a refreshing workout. Hiking trails allow you to explore other parts of the estate. If you prefer cycling, both paved and unpaved paths lead you on a leisurely tour.

Carolina Raptor Center is dedicated to environmental stewardship and the conservation of birds of prey through education, research, and the rehabilitation of injured and orphaned raptors.  We are a charitable 501(c)(3) non-profit organization and rely on public financial support to fulfill our mission.  Our environmental education programs reach approximately 40,000 students each year. Educators feel a responsibility to share their knowledge with our community in hopes that our enthusiasm will then be reflected in the faces in front of us.  At the head of the food web, raptors are leading scientific indicators of a healthy environment.

I have my experimenter hat on folks! DRI made from 5 exposures in PS. I know I'll never have the chance to savor the excitements of darkroom processing, so the next best I can get is the digital darkroom! I took five exposures into separate layers and then converted to smart object.  Stacked the layers to median pixel values. Finally reduced noise selectively with Define 2.0 and added a bit of glow to the fading sun to soften the light. I wish my subject were wearing a red coat instead of black!

A little later that day, I went to one of my favorite spots, and waited for someone to photograph. There is a large yellow building on the opposite side of the street on that said spot. On the afternoon the sun shines on that building and gives a wonderful reflecting light on that spot. I did not have to wait for a long time, when I saw the girl from earlier coming towards me. I was happy to see her again and having the chance to ask for a shot on that location. Needless to say, that I was even happier that she agreed on the photo, with what I think is one of my better shots, at least concerning the light, you can even see that large yellow building in the reflection in her eyes.

Vigevano is crowned by the Castello Sforzesco, a stronghold rebuilt 1492–94 for Ludovico Maria Sforza (Ludovico il Moro), the great patron born in the town, who transformed the fortification/hunting lodge of Luchino Visconti (who in turn had re-used a Lombard fortress) into a rich noble residence, at the cusp of Gothic and Renaissance. 

Leonardo da Vinci was his guest at Vigevano, as was Bramante, who is ascribed with the tall tower that watches over the piazza from the Castello Sforzesco. 

The old castle has a unique raised covered road, high enough for horsemen to ride through, that communicates between the new palace and the old fortifications; there is a Falconry, an elegant loggiato supported by 48 columns, and, in the rear area of the mastio, the Ladies' Loggia made for Duchess Beatrice d'Este.

Someone who came here to show their love to some precious one lying inanimately under the dirt. And this bear was left alone by mistake.
Both of them are lifeless. They don't know someone still loves them, misses them, thinks about them every single day. Perhaps they just don't care. After all, it's only love.

Auction now closed:

Congrats to Peter Kent from NSW, Australia with his winning bid of US $ 400.00!

And in a late night email, which I didn't see until the next morning,  Kenny Shields from Scotland matched Peter's $400 final bid.

So I'm going to make two prints, and this photo has now raised US $800.00 for Haiti Charity Relief!

See the bidding in the comments below.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

I have entered this image in to the Flickr group Charity Print Auctions:
<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/groups/charityprintauctions/"">www.flickr.com/groups/charityprintauctions/</a>
for the Haiti Earthquake Appeal.

The print that is for auction is 24 in. wide x 16 high (at 250dpi!) and will be printed on canvas, sealed with a semi-glossy protectant that makes the colors pop,  signed, and shipped to you in a roll.  And for the moment, it is (was) #1 in Explore too and the #1 most interesting photo out of 4+ million tagged with 'landscape' on Flickr .

To bid, you need to comment below the image with the amount that you would like to bid.

When the auction closes, the person that has bid the most, wins the print.

The auction will close on the date set in the thread, in the case of the Haiti Earthquake Appeal, it will finish on Sunday 17th January 2010 at midnight. If you wish to have the auction run for longer, you can do so but you must specify this in your text that accompanies your image.

The winning bidder has to pay that amount to the Red Cross:
<a href=""http://www.redcross.org.uk/emergencysite/default.aspx?id=88916"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">www.redcross.org.uk/emergencysite/default.aspx?id=88916</a>
When they do this, they MUST make a screen grab of the donation confirmation page to send to the photographer. This is the only way the photographer knows that you have paid and can arrange for the print to be sent to you.

The photographer accepts that they will pay the costs of production of the print and the postage to the winning bidder.

Story:
---------------------------------------------------------

Here is another view from the first annual Big Sur Photographic Summit held on the customary date of the winter solstice in the Northern Hemisphere.  There were a total of 2 attendees including  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/ivanomak/"">Ivan Makarov</a> and me.  The full package price was kept to a modest US $ 10,000.00 for the two-hour shoot with the first two attendees getting a $10,000 discount.  Fortunately I was one of the first two to sign up!

Seriously though, I could hardly believe the light on this evening.  It really was like painting a canvas, but without the smell of turpentine and the headaches that follow.  (Hint, use Lavendar Spike oil!) All I had to do was arrange the scene and wait for a nice curling aquamarine breaker to add the finishing touch.


The map shows exactly where this is.  It is an easy hike from the parking lot.

Cwm Idwal is a hanging valley in the Glyderau range of mountains in northern Snowdonia, the national park in the mountainous region of North Wales. Its main interest is to hill walkers and rock climbers, but it is also of interest to geologists and naturalists, given its combination of altitude (relatively high in UK terms), aspect (north-facing) and terrain (mountainous and rocky). In a 2005 poll conducted by Radio Times, Cwm Idwal was ranked the 7th greatest natural wonder in Britain.

Cwm Idwal is a spectacular product of glaciation, surrounded by high crags, screes, moraines and rounded rocks, with a lake on its floor (Llyn Idwal). Cwm Idwal comprises volcanic and sedimentary rock which was laid down in a shallow Ordovician sea, and later pushed up and deformed into the distinctive semicircular valley known today as the Idwal Syncline. This fold in the rock is visible today, thanks to the layering of the sedimentary rocks. The area was then eroded by glacial action to form the classic semicircular valley.

Given its elevation and north-facing aspect, Cwm Idwal is the most southerly place in Britain where Arctic plants such as moss campion and some alpine saxifrages, such as tufted saxifrage (Saxifraga cespitosa) and Saxifraga nivalis, can be found. It is also a home of the Snowdon lily, a plant which can only be found in the UK on Snowdon and its surroundings. Evan Roberts [1], the renowned botanist and explorer from Capel Curig, did probably as much as any other (self taught) botanist to document the area. The Snowdonia hawkweed, Hieracium snowdoniense is only known to occur in Cwm Idwal.

The Idwal slabs and the cliffs around the head of Cwm Idwal are a popular area for rock climbing; the Idwal Slabs (on the eastern side of the Cwm) in particular are popular with inexperienced climbers learning their skills. The Devil's Kitchen has some excellent ice climbing during the winter. It is also popular for hill walking and scrambling, given its proximity to Tryfan and Glyder Fach and Glyder Fawr and their profusion of rocky ridges.

In the mid to late 1950s and into the 1960s, this was the reunion excursion camp site of the first ascenders of Mount Everest and Kangchenjunga, held at Pen-y-Gwryd, many of whom were keen geologists and botanists.

The Great Stupa of Dharmakaya is located at the Shambhala Mountain Center near Red Feather Lakes, Colorado. 

Construction began in 1988 and artisans from around the word continue to work on it to this day (it was consecrated in August 2001). It is built to last a millennium. 

We are fortunate the public is invited, the Great Stupa is truly a work of art inside and out.  It's the largest stupa in the western hemisphere and  is also the largest and most elaborate example of Buddhist sacred architecture in North America. 

 The full name of the stupa is “The Great Stupa of Dharmakaya Which Liberates Upon Seeing.”  When you see it nestled in a picturesque valley of the gorgeous Colorado Rockies, the name somehow seems quite fitting.  

 Read more about this special place <a href=""http://www.shambhalamountain.org/stupa.html"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">here</a>.

Shot Notes: No flash of course and hand held using the Tokina 11-16 wide open f/2.8 at 1600 ISO on my D300.  Shot five bracketed shots; processed through DXO Optics Pro v6 with automatic lens distortion correction applied; and then blended all five frames together in Enfuse.  Enfuse really seems to shine on interior architectural images!"

4445820398,"Nato in Inghilterra nel 1804, il duca di Brunswick, a causa delle sue scappatelle, fu detronizzato e cacciato dal suo paese nel 1830.
Paranoico, con un complesso di persecuzione acuta, aveva insonorizzato la sua camera da letto e dotato il suo palazzo a Parigi di passaggi segreti.
E' stato un uomo inquieto ed inquietante. Linguista Illustre, cavaliere eccezionale e musicista, era anche un investitore eccezionale. Ha accumulato una enorme (e molto ambita) fortuna.
Dopo essersi rifugiato a Parigi, è giunto a Ginevra, dove ha trascorso gli ultimi tre anni della sua vita. Morì nel 1873, lasciando alla città, una bella sommetta di denaro, un gesto di generosità e di dimostrazione di fiducia verso il governo di Ginevra che avrebbe rispettato i termini del suo testamento.
Uno di questi ere che fosse costruito un mausoleo in una posizione eminente e degna, eseguiti secondo il concetto stabilito dai migliori artisti del tempo, senza tener conto del prezzo
Ciò è stato fatto, lungo il molo, tra Hôtel Beau-Rivage e Hôtel de la Paix. Come il Duca aveva previsto, il monumento è una replica esatta della tomba di famiglia degli Scaligeri a Verona, Italia.

The grace and chasteness of the Al Alam Royal Palace is a thing to marvel at. It is one of the most exclusive specimen of art and architecture of the whole country of Oman. The Al Alam Royal Palace in Muscat speaks wonders through its simplicity. The tall columns of the palace bask in the golden sunshine and reflect the turquoise blue waters of the calm ocean. The majesty of this somber palace is definitely a breathtaking view to feast your eyes on.

The Al Alam Royal Palace in Muscat is the official estate of the ruler of Oman, Sultan Qaboos. Visitors are allowed until the gates of this grand palace only. They are not allowed to enter the interiors of the Al Alam Royal Palace in Muscat . 

The Palace is used for official functions and receiving distinguished visitors and in January 2012, the Sultan received Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands at Al Alam Palace during her state visit to Oman. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_Alam_Palace"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">Wikipedia</a>

Plus, i just got back from camp and start rehearsals for Music and Missions week tomorrow. They last about five hours a day for the next five days and then the week after that we have to actually go out into the community and do the missions and performances.

<strong><u>About</u></strong>

Woke up this morning at 7am, the weather has been real cold for about a week now, I planned to take another trip to the nature reserve to take some pictures of the frozen brooks and creeks.
I went out to scrape the ice from the windows of my car but when I noticed there was also ice on the inside I gave up and decided to take my wifes car that was still in the garage, when I got out on the road the temperature indicator on the dashboard read -9°C, brrrr, this was going to be hard on the fingers, I can't wear gloves when taking pictures.

I stopped a first time to take this, it the same spot I've taken earlier in the year on a misty morning when there were still leaves on the trees :

Since ancient times, a site along the river has been mined for copper, silver, gold, and other minerals. In approximately 3,000 BCE, Iberians and Tartessians began mining the site, followed by the Phoenicians, Greeks, Romans, Visigoths, and Moors. After a period of abandonment, the mines were rediscovered in 1556 and the Spanish government began operating them once again in 1724. As a result of the mining, Río Tinto is notable for being very acidic (pH 2) and its deep reddish hue is due to iron dissolved in the water. Acid mine drainage from the mines leads to severe environmental problems due to the heavy metal concentrations in the river. In 1873, the multinational Rio Tinto Company was formed to operate the mines; by the end of the 20th century it had become one of the world's largest mining companies, although it no longer controls the Rio Tinto mines; these are now owned by EMED Mining plc.

The Bayon was built in the late 12th century or early 13th century as the official state temple of the Mahayana Buddhist King Jayavarman VII, the Bayon stands at the centre of Jayavarman's capital, Angkor Thom. Following Jayavarman's death, it was modified and augmented by later Hindu and Theravada Buddhist kings in accordance with their own religious preferences (Source: Wikipedia - I better do a bit of research to make sure I got the facts right this time :-D)

I think the Bayon is one of the most beautiful temples in the Angkor Wat complex. If you have limited time, I think you should visit nothing but:

1. Angkor Wat - the main temple
2. Angkor Thom - especially Bayon (this one)
3. Ta Prohm - the &quot;Tomb Raider&quot; temple

I also think unless you love temple ruins and want to take your time in doing your sunrises and sunsets there, a 3 day visit is more than enough in the Angkor Wat and Siem Reap region. Well, to be honest, 2 days in the Angkor Wat and a day in the floating villages will be ideal :-)

Just a plain simple shot of a very nice waterfall. So easy to get to, yet tucked away in the forest so nicely that it doesn't get much attention. The first time I shot this was back in June and the spring runoff from the mountains caused it to be a raging torrent. I could not get within 200 feet of it for the spray. Last month I came back with 2 friends and it was much less water and easier to shoot. Happy #Waterfallwednesday

New Yorkers are <i>serious</i> about their pizza.  

We always seem to be consuming it on the go. A quick slice to tide us over until our next meal, it's become the ultimate NYC &quot;fast food.&quot;  I can't tell you how many times I see people eating pizza on the street while walking and sometimes even talking (I saw a guy recently with a slice in one hand and a cellphone in the other).  Heck, I've seen people eat slices while in taxis, or in the subway (how do they even maneuver through the turnstiles when they don't even have the pizza in a box??).

I'm not even as big a pizza fan as some people (my current boyfriend Sion, and my ex, could both eat pizza almost every day), but I still get that irresistable craving once in a while whenever I see someone walking by with a slice being shoved in their mouths.  &quot;Mmm...that looks good!&quot;

It is <b>March</b>. For me it is kind of the <b>beginning</b> of <b>spring!</b> Best time to post an <b>autumn photo</b> :). Sometimes I wonder why I always post my photos in the completely different time of the year… 

However. This photo was taken in <b>summer</b>. I used <b>Photoshop</b> technique to give the <b>autumn touch</b>. Some might think it is <b>crazy</b> but as I <b>post processed</b> the photo I really felt the <b>autumn mood</b> and the <b>earthly tones</b>. The whole scene reminds me on the <b>Lord of the Rings</b> scene where <b>Merry</b> and <b>Pippin</b> take the tree ride as they are persecuted by the ugly <b>ORK!</b>

You can see the <b>“unprocessed”</b> version of the photo in the <b>comment section</b>. 

The photo was taken at a <b>lonely road</b> somewhere in <b>Kyoto, Japan.</b> I really stood in <b>awe</b> of this <b>Monumentum</b>. Let’s just think for a second I am <b>26 years</b> old, you might be <b>younger</b> or <b>older</b> but <b>how old might this tree be</b>? <b>50 years</b>? Naahhh more <b>200-500 years</b> I would guess. 

This somehow leads me to an <b>important question</b> which I wan’t to mention but not give any more thoughts on. How can it be that we, the <b>western world</b>, support cutting down these old trees all over the world for nearly <b>no money</b> only to get <b>new furniture</b> every other year. We don’t know how the world will be without these <b>natural air cleaners…</b> 

<b>Just a thought!</b>

Anyways I think there are some really smart people who discuss on these topics. 

<b>By the way:</b> If you think you need the <b>new Nikon D800/ D800E/ D4</b> look at the photo and know it has been taken with and <b>old Canon 350D</b> with the <b>18-55 kit lens</b>... :D

&quot;Passion&quot; does not refer to love, but to the Passion of Christ on the cross. In the 15th and 16th centuries, Spanish Christian missionaries discovered this flower and adopted its unique physical structures as symbols of Crucifixion. For example: the 72 radial filaments (or corona) represent the Crown of Thorns. The ten petals and sepals represent the ten faithful apostles. The top 3 stigmata represent the 3 nails and the lower 5 anthers represent the 5 wounds. The flower has been given names related to this symbolism throughout Europe since that time."

The urban area had an estimated population of 2.26 million in 2001. The city is at the centre of the larger Frankfurt Rhine Main Area which has a population of 5.3 million and is Germany's second largest metropolitan area.

Situated on the River Main, Frankfurt is the financial and transportation centre of Germany and one of the two largest financial centres in continental Europe, the other being Paris. It is the place of residence of the European Central Bank, the German Federal Bank, the Frankfurt Stock Exchange and the Frankfurt Trade Fair, as well as several large commercial banks. Frankfurt International Airport is one of the world's busiest airports, Frankfurt Central Station is one of the largest terminal stations in Europe, and the Frankfurter Kreuz (Autobahn interchange) is the most heavily used interchange in continental Europe. Frankfurt is the only German city listed as one of ten Alpha world cities.

Among English speakers the city is commonly known simply as &quot;Frankfurt&quot;, though Germans occasionally call it by its full name when it is necessary to distinguish it from the other (significantly smaller) Frankfurt in the German state of Brandenburg, known as Frankfurt (Oder). It is also called Frankfort-on-the-Main in English, a translation of Frankfurt am Main.

I have been there hunting these mornings for awhile without success. Yesterday was close to perfection although no sun and no rays but hey! you can't have it all. Still a morning full of shots and I had to be dragged out of the place. I was delighted with so much beauty i don't have the words to describe.

<i>&quot;Stress is like dark chocolate. A little of it won't kill you. In fact, small blocks here and there can be good for you, or at least give you a reason to get out of bed in the morning. But chronic and severe stress can damage your body and mind, blocking the fluid communication to and from most organs--especially in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and in the limbic system, the brain's emotional center. Believe me, you want these two systems running as smoothly as possible, with low levels of the delinquent stress hormones in your bloodstream.&quot;  </i>

6059495356,"The State of Kuwait (i/kuːˈweɪt/; Arabic: دولة الكويت‎, Dawlat al-Kuwayt) is a sovereign Arab nation situated in the north-east of the Arabian Peninsula in Western Asia. It is bordered by Saudi Arabia to the south at Khafji, and Iraq to the north at Basra. It lies on the north-western shore of the Persian Gulf. The name Kuwait is derived from the Arabic &quot;akwat&quot;, the plural of &quot;kout&quot;, meaning fortress built near water.[5] The Emirate covers an area of 17,820 square kilometers (6,880 sq mi) and has a population of about 3.6 million.[2]
Historically, the region was the site of Characene, a major Parthian port for trade between India and Mesopotamia. The Bani Utbah Tribe were the first permanent Arab settlers in the region and laid the foundation of the modern emirate. By the 19th century, Kuwait came under the influence of the Ottoman Empire, and after World War I, it emerged as an independent sheikhdom under the protection of the British Empire. Kuwait's large oil fields were discovered in the late 1930s.
After Kuwait gained independence from the United Kingdom in 1961, the nation's oil industry saw unprecedented economic growth. In 1990, Kuwait was invaded and annexed by neighboring Iraq. The seven month-long Iraqi occupation came to an end after a direct military intervention by United States-led forces. Around 773 Kuwaiti oil wells were set ablaze by the retreating Iraqi army resulting in a major environmental and economic catastrophe.[6] Kuwait's infrastructure was badly damaged during the war and had to be rebuilt.[7]

As you enter, the first thing that holds your attention is the main Altar, as every main alter should. Behind it, towers a huge marble tabernacle with a niche, on which is enshrined a statue of our Lady of Graces. This statue is not from the time of the Begum. Instead there was first a beautifully painted picture of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart, that now adorns the Seminary chapel at St. John's. It was removed when a statue of Our Lady of the Sacred Heart was brought out from France specially for the church, in the middle of the last century, by the first nuns of Jesus and Mary. But this statue being too big for the niche never suited it. It was replaced early in this century by another statue of Our Lady of Lourdes, and then by the present statue about 30 years ago. The first statue is now the treasured possession of the Convent of Jesus and Mary, where it stands enshrined in a garden, at the back of the church."

I've got my heart set on anywhere but here
I'm staring down myself, counting up the years
Steady hands, just take the wheel...
And every glance is killing me
Time to make one last appeal... for the life I lead

Stop and stare
I think I'm moving but I go nowhere
Yeah I know that everyone gets scared
But I've become what I can't be, oh
Stop and stare
You start to wonder why you're 'here' not there
And you'd give anything to get what's fair
But fair ain't what you really need
Oh, can u see what I see

They're tryin to come back, all my senses push
Un-tie the weight bags, I never thought I could...
Steady feet, don't fail me now
Gonna run till you can't walk
But something pulls my focus out
And I'm standing down...

La Cupola della Roccia impropriamente chiamata talora Moschea della Roccia, è il più noto santuario islamico di Gerusalemme e uno dei più importanti di tutto il mondo islamico. Completata nel 691, è l'edificio islamico più antico del mondo ancora oggi esistente.Il Monte sul Tempio rappresenta un luogo sacro alle tre religioni monoteiste del mondo. Fu in quel punto, infatti, che Abramo voleva sacrificare a Dio suo figlio Isacco, fermato dalla mano dell'Angelo. Lì fu edificato da Salomone il primo tempio in muratura dedicato all'unico Dio. Lì Maometto incontrò l'Angelo."

2405665912,"Video on flickr. I personally abhor the idea of video on flickr, for many reasons. I can aaaalmost understand why some people would want this feature, but I intend to stay video virgin. If you want to add videos on your stream, fine... but I don't think I'll watch any on flickr. Because flickr is slow enough for me as it is. I watch videos elsewhere. When I feel like it. Here, my major interest is photography.

Along with the video, they launched new group administration features. Now you can decide if your group accept safe only, moderated or restricted.
This is causing a lot of pain in the *** for lots of people because for example: a girl, wearing a bikini, on the beach, even if the photo is &quot;safe&quot; for some reason it isn't accepted in the pool of a group named &quot;somewhere in the world a woman is wearing a bikini&quot;.
But it's happening the same with landscape, kids, kitties etc. Safe photos for some reason are being considerated moderated.

So, I can't add lots of my photos to lots of my groups. Since my photos aren't displayed on explore's first pages anymore, I really don't care when &quot;they make it to explore&quot; because accordingly to my stats, in a week, they get a 100 views from explore.
Depending on the group I add a photo, I get a lot more, in a shorter period of time. So, now the views on my work are once again boycotted.

Flickr staff seem to have majored in the &quot;how to make people hate your guts&quot; school. Not only they take the users for granted, they use word play and slippery responses when addressing to the whining masses; instead of being direct, objective and as sincere as possible, considering their position.

They don't ever make announcements of new features before launching them, never apologize for their mistakes and questionable decisions and are painfully slow in explaining what's going on when things are falling apart.
Truly and deeply, it's only my consideration for the friends I've made here, and my consideration for my *real* friends that are just now getting &quot;addicted&quot; to visiting my photos that I'll stay, otherwise, I would have left.
This site, thinks really little of its users.

~~~~~~~~~

Video no flickr. Odiei essa idéia, por vários motivos. Eu quaaaase posso entender porque alguém iria querer isso aqui no flickr, mas eu pretendo permanecer virgem de videos. Se você quer adicionar videos no flickr, tudo bem... mas não acho que vou assistir videos no flickr. Porque o flickr já é lento o suficiente para mim, como está. Eu assisto videos em outros lugares. Quando estou afim. Aqui, meu maior interesse é fotografia.

Junto com o video, fizeram o favor de lançar novidades que saíram do rabo de um jerico/do saci para administração de grupos. Agora você pode decidir se seu grupo aceita fotos seguras, moderadas ou restritas.
Isso está causando tormentos para um monte de gente porque por exemplo: uma garota, de biquini, na praia, mesmo se a foto for &quot;segura&quot; por algum motivo tosco, não está sendo aceita no grupo chamado &quot;em algum lugar do mundo, uma mulher está usando um biquini&quot;.
Mas isso está acontecendo também com paisagens, crianças, gatinhos, etc... Fotos seguras, por algum motivo estão sendo consideradas moderadas.

Então, eu não consigo adicionar várias das minhas fotos em vários dos meus grupos. Já que minhas fotos não vão mais para as primeiras páginas do explore, eu não me importo quando elas vão pro explore, porque de acordo com a estatística, elas recebem umas 100 visitas em uma semana.
Dependendo do grupo q eu adiciono uma foto, eu recebo muito mais visitas, em menos tempo. Então, agora as visitas nas minhas fotos estão sendo boicotadas mais uma vez.

Os funcionários do flickr têm o dom de fazer as pessoas os odiarem, de verdade. Dão respostas evasivas e usando jogo de palavras. 

Nunca anunciam mudaças antes d'as lançarem, nunca se desculpam pelos erros e escolhas equivocadas e são dolorosamente lerdos em dar explicações para as desgraças que acontecem no site.
Esse site, tem em pouca conta seus usuários. "

Tiger's always on a hunt in our house. This was shot just seconds before he jumped onto the kitchen cabinet when he heard the chirping of the gecko crawling on the wall. He must be saying <i>&quot;Did anyone mention dinner?&quot;</i> He usually left just the gecko's head lying on the floor the next morning as a leftover for the ants. Forgive me, I know it sounds a little cruel but it's just dinner for Tiger. Doing candid shots of fast paced animals with a MF lens ain't that easy for me, but luckily it's digital, so after a few frames you get one or two keepers.

The Barb Horse

The Barb is a light riding horse noted for its stamina. It has a powerful front end, high withers, short back, a sloping croup, and carries its tail low. It is hardy with clean legs, and small, round, sound hooves. It does not have particularly good gaits, but gallops like a sprinter. It was used as breeding stock to develop racing breeds such as the Thoroughbred, American Quarter Horse, and Standardbred.
The predominant color is gray, but bay, black, chestnut, and brown horses are also found. The Barb stands 1.47–1.57 metres (14.2–15.2 h) at the withers.(From Wiki)"

Ora quant'è forte,
scroscio acuminato.
Il pomeriggio è finito 
In un freddo quieto,
d’attesa,
l’aria immobile davanti al palcoscenico,
al sipario che si sarebbe scostato.
Poi è arrivata sera,
sola,
ed era ancora quiete,
quieto freddo paziente,
buio ovattato opaco,
e dal cielo ancora niente.
Poi come paggi,
menestrelli,
le prime gocce
a fare l’annuncio.
E prima che fosse finito,
prima che tacessero,
che il freddo s’accomodasse,
lo scroscio.
Acuminato,
come chiodo in un’asse si ficcano gocce affilate
nelle piante assiderate.
E’ pioggia, le dico,
ma quant’è forte, irruenta.
Rumoreggia.
Pare grandine, le dico,
da quant’è violenta.
E scostata la tenda 
la vedo:
gocce fatte piccoli chicchi.
Dura un attimo.
Vento ubriaco,
euforia impetuosa,
balla feroce e scianca la notte,
e tira nel ballo la neve
sotto al lampione
davanti al lampione,
e sembra ondeggi, 
la sua luce, 
sembra ondeggi sull’alto metallico fusto.
E sembra tutto giusto.
Non è pioggia, le dico,
quant’è forte, irruenta.
Non è grandine, le dico,
eppure quant’è violenta.
Discosta la tenda la guardo:
Tormenta.

In the 1980s, a 12-year-old almost died in a sink hole, and the government, having failed to put the fire out, decided it was cheaper to just condemn the whole town. For the past 20 years, as the few holdouts have died or finally moved away, their houses have been razed. When I was in high school 10 years ago, you could still see houses in the town. Today, it's pretty much an empty field with a few remnants of a street grid. 

Depending on where the fire is strongest and the outside atmosphere, smoke pours pretty continuously from the ground. The place looks like Mordor, and the smell of sulfer will cling to you for hours. "

1. I adore balloons. 
2. Russian <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sqdiEUp6s4E"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">Winnie the Pooh</a> cartoon is priceless! 
3. I can't live without <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/8166053@N08/1472133115"">tomatoes</a>. 
4. I call Moscow, London, Boston, New York and Vienna my home.
5. And I'm moving to Paris in less than six weeks. Because, well, why not?
6. I don't like thinking about space. There's enough to fascinate me on this Planet. 
7. I think <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fijTqLEWBI8"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">Kingdom of Shades</a> from La Bayadere is the most mesmerising piece of ballet. 
8. I am currently obsessed with the quirky French avant-garde sounds of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y9Od0e17Zjo"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">Camille</a> and timeless blues of <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2oQegBHYokE"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">Melody Gardot</a>
9. I think the way we react to fortuitous events shapes our lives.
10. I don't like arrogance, ignorance, prejudice and when my feet are freezing.

Happy Monday, everyone! :o)

Here in this shot, I still did it handheld (3 exposures) with my 10-22mm Canon EF-S lens. After this one, I took out the tripod and mounted my camera and carried it around on my shoulder, earning many curious looks and even some enquiries as to why I would use a tripod.
10mm is a fun experience, esp. when you get up close! I was very close on this one.

Last Call @ Cline's On The River

I took a lot of photos at the Cline's On The River going away bash which was  one of the best times I've ever had at my beloved hang out of 17 years.  I had no intention of using any of the pictures for anything than just snapshots for the Facebook page, in fact I had to go out to the car and get my manual just to figure out how to use my built in flash being that I've never used it before.  Of the 700+ photos I took, this one of my friend Matt stood out.

Hopefully going to be getting back into the groove of things.  With all attention going to the bar for the last few days, and an awful 2 1/2 day hangover I've had to neglect almost everything else.

I cant remember exactly where this is precisely except that it is in what is left of what never was Salton City; a ghost city which appears on google maps but is in fact not there save for graded gravel driveways which would have been streets and skeletal framework of telephone poles which hold aloft wires that are functionless and power or communicate nothing. 
There is a section if the city which was once populated by trailer homes and has since been eviscerated by weather and salt from the dying lake on which the city is named. Being there, the places is eerily silent and is reminiscent of of the opening scenes in Robert Wise's film depiction of Micheal Chrichton's 'The Andromeda Strain' where a small town is wiped out by an alien contaminant.

The clouds would mass over the ridges, but the sun would simultaneously be on the verge of breaking through, and the result was the most ethereal, glowing light I've ever seen.

So out I went with my all knowing ten year old host sister, Christiana. She spotted this spider web within a few seconds, and we tried sprinkling some water on the web to mimic dew drops (with miserable outcome). The water just would not stick on the web (next time I will try some viscous liquid!). Anyway, this is a &quot;non dew drop&quot; spider web picture, and Miss S.

The Hackesche Höfe consists of a web of eight courtyards for living and working, which together forms the largest of its kind in Germany. Like many Berlin courtyards, this complex of buildings, which arose around the turn of the last century, was a mixture of offices, workshops, multi-story factories (particularly in the front courtyards) and apartments. This concept was also adopted and successfully applied during the modernization of the courtyards, which were in serious need of renovation. Hof I (Endellscher Hof), which was designed by the Jugendstil artist and architect August Endell, houses the &quot;Chamäleon&quot; cabaret theatre, a film theatre, and several bars and restaurants; in Hof II (Theaterhof) there is the Hackesche Hof Theatre and a series of architects' offices; the remaining courtyards are occupied by numerous smaller shops and galleries. The area around the Höfe is also thriving: with countless bars, restaurants and clubs; it is one of Berlin nightlife's most talked-about districts."

The problem is that the camera was still set to all manual modes from last night's starry sky shot, so I just had enough time to switch it to aperture priority and take a single shot before the lights turned green and I had to move on.

The fact that the lens was set to manual focus and was focused at the infinity from last night didn't help much with the sharpness of the shot but the 17mm wide angle lens at f/5 still rendered decent details."

Genova, Liguria. It was a beautiful evening in late spring and with my friend decided to go out for dinner near Levanto seaport in the majestic Ligurian east coast. When we had finished eating, headed to the seashore and walked on the shoreline while I could see a suggestive lightnings storm at the skyline west coast. Just turning back to Genova round midnight, the weather gets worse starting to rain! But suddenly the weather changes near Bogliasco coast; I could not hope for anything better now! Going back to home for bring my reflex and ride on my Vespa headin' toward Sturla beach. Cold, downpour .. but the desire to stay in that beach was unstoppable.

I had taken this shot with my Nikon D3100 and Nikkor 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6G VR lens, supported by a polarizing filter Hoya CIR-PL HD. The night was not so dark, choosing to set a long exposure time of 4 seconds at 100 ISO with a not so bright diaphragm aperture because the storm was not so far. In this area, the seashore is not so wide and I had chosen to set a focal length at 36 mm to have a good view and capture more possible lightnings: I'd say, mission accomplished.

Yes, it's straight and flat and doesn't have a lot of explosively beautiful landscapes, but the flat stretches of waving grass, distant mountains and miles of quiet are enchanting to this northwesterner.  I took <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/aralani/262326042"">another shot</a> from further back toward Rawlins two years ago, and was happy to return with a different perspective.

I took this shot with my 9-stop ND filter, trying to capture the movement in the grass, the limitless distance, and the brilliant colors of the sunset.  It's very... Wyoming.  I love the wild empty beauty.  The sun is blown out, but I like the effect very much.  It's blinding in person, too.

In the 1980s, a 12-year-old almost died in a sink hole, and the government, having failed to put the fire out, decided it was cheaper to just condemn the whole town. For the past 20 years, as the few holdouts have died or finally moved away, their houses have been razed. When I was in high school 10 years ago, you could still see houses in the town. Today, it's pretty much an empty field with a few remnants of a street grid. 

Depending on where the fire is strongest and the outside atmosphere, smoke pours pretty continuously from the ground. The place looks like Mordor, and the smell of sulfer will cling to you for hours. "

The Superstition Mountains, popularly referred to as &quot;The Superstitions&quot; or &quot;The Supes&quot;, are a range of mountains in Arizona located to the east of the Phoenix metropolitan area. They are anchored by Superstition Mountain, a large mountain that is a popular recreation destination for residents of the Phoenix, Arizona area.

The mountain range is in the federally-designated Superstition Wilderness Area, and includes a variety of natural features in addition to the mountain that is its namesake. Weaver's Needle, a prominent landmark and rock climbing destination set behind and to the east of Superstition Mountain, is a tall erosional remnant [1] that plays a significant role in the legend of the Lost Dutchman's Gold Mine. Peralta Canyon, on the northeast side of Superstition Mountain, contains a popular trail that leads up to Freemont Saddle, which provides a very picturesque view of Weaver's Needle.

Quite a messy shot... Besides the obvious health and safety issues, the contrast of the light was a bit extreme (it was actually very dark inside) and fluctuant. I had to pick up my kid from nursery in less than an hour, so I couldn't afford spending time to shoot more than 3 long-time exposures per angle (for a total of 141). Then I've completely messed up the color balance - <i>tant pis</i>, with overblown lights and in black and white is much more powerful anyway. I don't usually retake shots, but this place deserves another visit - if I'll have the luck to find that door still open, that is."

El condado de Ampudia es un título nobiliario español, creado el 31 de diciembre de 1602, por el rey Felipe III, para su valido Don Francisco de Sandoval y Rojas, I Duque de Lerma.

<b>Historia del condado</b>

Sancho de Rojas, obispo de Palencia y arzobispo de Toledo, dona a su sobrino Pedro García de Herrera, Señor de Salvatierra el feudo de Fuent Pudia. Éste consiguió de Juan II privilegio para instituir mayorazgo con la villa. Su hijo, Pedro García López de Ayala colocará los escudos Herrera, Ayala y Rojas en el pórtico del castillo.
Al agotarse la línea primogénita de los Ayala, pasó en 1597 a poder de Francisco de Sandoval y Rojas y Borja el cual eleva la condición del señorío, a Condado de Ampudia 1602, siendo además Duque de Lerma, valido de Felipe III. Después de la abolición de los mayorazgos en el S. XIX y estando el título en manos del Duque de Osuna cayó en pleitos dinásticos. En la separación de la Casa, el título recayó en la Casa del Infantado, mientras que el Ducado de Lerma recayó en la Casa de Medinaceli.

2751742862,"The lion dance originated in China close to a thousand years ago. The lion is traditionally regarded as a guardian creature.
The Lion dance is often confused with the Chinese Dragon Dance, which features a team of around ten or more dancers. The Lion Dance usually consists of two people.
The dance has close relations to kung fu and the dancers are usually members of the local kung fu club.
It is usually performed as a ceremony to exorcise evil spirits and to summon luck and fortune. 
This photo was taken at a party where Professor Guilherme Bom Costa was the Lion's head and Instructor André Castanheira was the tail.
They teach kung fu at Hung Gar Li Hon Ki Academy under the Master Renata Balestrini supervision.
Renata (and sometimes Guilherme) travels all around the world to give Kati instructions, lectures and to be part of the jury for belt changing exams.

A dança tem relação com o kung fu e os dançarinos são membros da academia de kung fu local.
É feita geralmente como cerimônia para exorcisar maus espíritos e atrair sorte e prosperidade.
Essa foto foi tirada em uma festa onde o Professor Guilherme Bom Costa era a cabeça e o instrutor André Castanheira era o derrière.
Esses ensinam kung fu na academia Punhos unidos Hung Gar Li Hon Ki, sob a supervisão da mestra Renata Balestrini.
Renata (e às vezes o Guilherme) viajam para praticamente qualquer lugar para ensinarem katis, darem palestras e fazerem parte da banca examinadora para troca de cinto. (E em Londrina, fazem apresentações de dança do Leão em qualquer evento, casamento, festa, etc)

In the 1980s, a 12-year-old almost died in a sink hole, and the government, having failed to put the fire out, decided it was cheaper to just condemn the whole town. For the past 20 years, as the few holdouts have died or finally moved away, their houses have been razed. When I was in high school 10 years ago, you could still see houses in the town. Today, it's pretty much an empty field with a few remnants of a street grid. 

Depending on where the fire is strongest and the outside atmosphere, smoke pours pretty continuously from the ground. The place looks like Mordor, and the smell of sulfer will cling to you for hours. "

A recreation hall was built at the northeast end of the complex and was used as a community center for dances, church services, movies, funerals, and town meetings.

Many of the buildings in Bodie are set up as if the inhabitants walked away and left them in their original state, although it's a bit of stagecraft by the park service, of course. But the artifacts are authentic and over the years the dust builds up and the wallpaper is allowed to peel, making for some fascinating scenes if you suspend your disbelief for awhile.
Tricky set up here, darkened room except for the moonlight streaming in through the window, lens against the dirty glass of the front door, lighting by AA mag lights through the other windows. Also the room in back was lit by Troy Paiva doing his Lost America thing. We had to coordinate our shutters and lights but if you work together more than one person can shoot in these crowded workshop locations.
--
Bodie is a ghost town in the hills east of the Sierras, founded as a mining camp after gold was discovered in the area.  It was a tough town in a harsh environment, where murders and hangings where common. It once had as many as 2,000 buildings including 65 saloons and 2 churches, but most were destroyed in one day by fire in 1892. 
It was completely abandoned by 1950 and is now kept in a state of &quot;arrested decay&quot; by the California park service.

I have begun to suspect that this light-leak-type burning i get on some of my images is in fact not a camera leak. It appears on the left side of my vertical images and on the top edge of my horizontal compositions.

Initially, I figured it was related to a crack in the barrel of my Ks super II. However, a crack in the barrel, being in front of the shutter, would not really create the hot spot I am getting.

I shot this image with my EOS rebel. I am certain that it does not have a light leak.

So, I am either dealing with a scanning issue or perhaps something strange is going on in my developing tank. I will have to go back and look at the images where I have this burning and see if I can correlate a cause.

Has anyone ever had a similar scanning problem like this?

2800783635,"Murano (founded by Romans centuries ago) lies about a mile north of Venice and is famous for its glass making, particularly lampworking. -It was once an independent comune, but is now a località of the comune of Venice.-

Murano’s reputation as a center for glassmaking was born when the Venetian Republic, fearing fire and destruction to the city’s mostly wood buildings, ordered glassmakers to move their foundries to Murano in 1291. Murano glass is still interwoven with Venetian glass.

Murano's glassmakers were soon the island’s most prominent citizens. By the 14th century, glass makers were allowed to wear swords, enjoyed immunity from prosecution by the Venetian state and found their daughters married into Venice’s most affluent families. Of course there was a catch: glassmakers weren't allowed to leave the Republic. However, many craftsmen took this risk and set up glass furnaces in surrounding cities and as far afield as England and the Netherlands.

<b><u>PREFACE</u></b>

&quot;<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow""><b>SHADHINOTA </b></a> is My Cause for the 40th Celebration of BANGLADESH Independence. The land, the mighty rivers and the natural beauty makes Bangladesh a land of unparalleled splendor and magnificence. Bangladesh was liberated after a prolonged war of Independence the declaration of which was given on 26th MARCH 1971. One of the worst genocides <a href=""http://www.genocidebangladesh.org/"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow""><b> Genocide</b></a> in history took place at the behest of an autocratic regime in the name of Political stability spearheaded by the then Pakistan President <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Khan"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow""><b> Yah ya Khan</b></a>. After 9 months of Liberation water and the sacrifice of 3 million lives Victory came. In addition to the loss of lives countless others were rendered homeless, the infrastructure including roads and bridges and factories lay in ruins. The people of Bangladesh have shown time and again how resilient they are. After each and every disaster, natural or man-made the people have again stood up and started all over again from scratch.
My Effort here is to pay tribute to the valiant sons of the soil and the ‘die hard’ attitude of a people who can still smile in the face of adversity however great it may be. I plan to make a collage of images that represent the lives of the people of Bangladesh. I encourage you to upload a photo each day till I have a total of 40 images for the Cause <b>SHADHINOTA in the group<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/groups/1536473@N22/""> Frame BANGLADESH</a></b>&quot;

Su talla y su potencia le permiten capturar especies de tamaño medio, y su larga cola constituye un timón muy eficaz para efectuar bruscos cambios de rumbo cuando persigue a sus víctimas por el aire.

Huésped de los grandes macizos forestales, establece sus terrenos de caza en los linderos, en los amplios calveros y en los campos salpicados de setos. Emboscado en una rama – su discreta librea le asegura un excelente camuflaje –, espera pacientemente que una presa se mueva en la vecindad. Llegado el momento, abandona su retiro y se lanza sobre su víctima antes de que ésta tenga tiempo de huir.

El Azor Común está en vías de desaparición. Sin embargo, contribuye a limitar el número de Arrendajos, Urracas, Cuervos y Palomas, sus presas favoritas.

4833969549,"<b>Canal de Castilla - Medina de Rioseco</b>

El Canal de Castilla es una de las obras de ingeniería civil (hidráulica) más importantes de las realizadas entre mediados del siglo XVIII y el primer tercio del XIX. Recorre parte de las provincias de Burgos, Palencia y Valladolid en la comunidad autónoma de Castilla y León (España). Fue construido para facilitar el transporte del trigo de Castilla hacia los puertos del norte y de allí a otros mercados. Sin embargo, la llegada del ferrocarril pronto lo hizo quedar obsoleto.
El Canal discurre a lo largo de 207 km uniendo las localidades de Alar del Rey (Palencia), donde tiene su nacimiento, y las de Valladolid y Medina de Rioseco, situadas respectivamente al final de los ramales sur y de Campos (El Canal tiene forma de y invertida).

La provincia de Palencia es la que más kilómetros de canal tiene (ramal norte). Algunos kilómetros al norte de la capital palentina el canal se divide en dos grandes ramales que se dirigen uno a Medina de Rioseco (ramal de Campos) y otro a Valladolid (ramal sur).
A su paso por la ciudad de Palencia, a la que se acerca mediante un ramalillo terminado en una dársena para facilitar las tareas de carga y descarga, el Canal de Castilla se sitúa a escasa distancia de dos puntos emblemáticos del mismo: Calahorra de Ribas, donde el Canal se cruza con el río Carrión del que pasa a tomar las aguas; y el Serrón, en Grijota, donde el canal se bifurca en los ramales de Campos y del Sur. Precisamente en Calahorra de Ribas se puede leer un monumental hito erigido para conmemorar la unión de los ríos Carrión y Pisuerga en agosto de 1791:

En el Reinado del Señor Don Carlos IV y de su esposa Dña Luisa María (sic) a expensas del Real Erario, siendo Ministro de él el Excmo Señor Conde de Lerena, bajo cuyas órdenes dirigió la obra el Coronel Juan de Homar, Caballero de Calatrava&quot;. Era el Conde de Lerena, Don Pedro López de Lerena y Cuenca, Ministro de Hacienda en aquellos años.

<b>Precedentes</b>

Los antecedentes de esta gran obra hidráulica se remontan a los siglos XVI y XVII. El desarrollo de sistemas de navegación interiores en Europa, que fomentará el comercio y el regadío, se traducen en España en estudios dirigidos por Bartolomé Bustamante en 1549 sobre las posibilidades que ofrecía la cuenca del Pisuerga.
El siglo XVIII verá desempolvar estos viejos proyectos en tiempos de Fernando VI por iniciativa del Marqués de la Ensenada. La idea ilustrada de la mejora de las comunicaciones interiores como fomento de la actividad económica tomará cuerpo con dos realizaciones fundamentales: el Canal Imperial de Aragón y el Canal de Castilla.

<b>La obra</b>

El canal de Castilla, es uno de los proyectos más importantes de ingeniería civil de la España Ilustrada, su objetivo principal fue servir como vía de comunicación y transporte que solucionase el problema de aislamiento que sufría la meseta castellana, debido a relieve complicado y una deficiente red viaria, que hacía casi imposible el transporte de los productos agrarios de la región. A mediados del siglo XVIII, el rey Fernando VI y su ministro, el Marqués de la Ensenada, empezaron a pensar en un plan para potenciar la economía de España, es entonces cuando el Marqués sugiere a Fernando VI la construcción de una red de caminos y canales de transporte pensados para Castilla, al ser, por entonces, la principal productora de cereales. Dos años después, Antonio de Ulloa, prestigioso ingeniero presenta el “Proyecto General de los Canales de Navegación y Riego para los Reinos de Castilla y León” inspirado en anteriores trabajos del francés Carlos Lemaur. Las obras del canal comenzaron el 16 de julio de 1753 en Calahorra de Ribas, bajo la dirección de Antonio de Ulloa y el ingeniero jefe Carlos Lemaur, en el tramo conocido como Ramal de Campos. Al año de haberse iniciado se paralizan, habiéndose construido hasta entonces 25 km, desde Calahorra de Ribas. Mas tarde, en 1759, las obras se reanudan, pero esta vez se inician en el estrecho de Nogales, cerca de Alar del Rey, fue así como comenzaron la construcción del Ramal del Norte, siendo finalizadas las obras de este ramal en agosto de 1791, cuando las aguas del Norte se unen con las del Ramal Campos en el lugar de Calahorra de Ribas.
Al año siguiente de la finalización del Ramal Norte se inicia la navegación en Alar del Rey, a la vez que se comienzan las obras del Ramal Sur hacía Valladolid. La Guerra de la Independencia y la posterior crisis política, económica y social ocasionaron grandes destrozos en lo ya construido, y obligaron a paralizar las obras en Soto Alburez en el año 1804.
El rey Fernando VII, viendo que el Erario Público no era capaz de seguir financiando el coste de la obra, dicta en septiembre de 1828, una Real Orden para que el proyecto pudiera ser realizado por una empresa privada. De esta forma, en 1831 el Estado concede a la “Compañía del Canal de Castilla” la explotación del Canal durante 80 años, una vez terminadas las obras. A cambio se compromete a finalizar las obras en siete años. De nuevo la guerra impide el cumplimiento de los plazos establecidos, por lo que es necesario un nuevo contrato mediante el cual se acorta el plazo de explotación a 70 años, y se amplía el plazo para realizar las obras. Una vez privatizada su construcción en 1835 se finaliza el Ramal del Sur con la llegada de las aguas al río Pisuerga a Valladolid, y en 1849 se ve finalizado el Ramal de Campos bajo el reinado de Isabel II. Así el 14 de diciembre de 1849 comienza la explotación del Canal de Castilla por la “Compañía del Canal de Castilla” y un periodo de 70 años, revertirá de nuevo al Estado, que lo administra desde entonces, dependiendo de la Confederación Hidrográfica del Duero. Aunque la navegación comenzó a finales del siglo XVIII, la época de mayor esplendor tuvo lugar entre los años 1850-1860, cuando las barcas que surcaban el Canal superaban las 350.Pero fue a partir de la apertura de la línea férrea Valladolid-Alar del Rey, con un trazado casi paralelo al del Canal de Castilla, cuando se limita y cede su utilización como vía de transporte y comunicación”. No obstante su cauce sigue proporcionando otros usos derivados de la fuerza motriz, generando un desarrollo económico e industrial en las localidades por las que discurre y propiciando que nazcan fábricas de papel, harinas, cueros, molinos, armas e incluso astilleros...

Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary
43:6-11 The way to forget our miseries, is to remember the God of our mercies. David saw troubles coming from God's wrath, and that discouraged him. But if one trouble follow hard after another, if all seem to combine for our ruin, let us remember they are all appointed and overruled by the Lord. David regards the Divine favour as the fountain of all the good he looked for. In the Saviour's name let us hope and pray. One word from him will calm every storm, and turn midnight darkness into the light of noon, the bitterest complaints into joyful praises. Our believing expectation of mercy must quicken our prayers for it. At length, is faith came off conqueror, by encouraging him to trust in the name of the Lord, and to stay himself upon his God. He adds, And my God; this thought enabled him to triumph over all his griefs and fears. Let us never think that the God of our life, and the Rock of our salvation, has forgotten us, if we have made his mercy, truth, and power, our refuge. Thus the psalmist strove against his despondency: at last his faith and hope obtained the victory. Let us learn to check all unbelieving doubts and fears. Apply the promise first to ourselves, and then plead it to God.

5063175411,"I took a run down past Harrisonburg Va and picked up the Skyline Drive off of Rt 33. I drove another 20 miles down to Doyles Gap Overlook and hiked (8 miles round trip from where I parked) down to the falls. Unfortunately the Falls were a bit dried up but the views were still spectacular.

A side note here; Make sure you look in more than one place on the web when you do research on someplace you've never been before. The Wikepedia page said that this was a relatively short hike. Now I must say, it wasn't that long, except I parked at the wrong area and ended up following the Appalachian trail for a mile before picking up the Doyles River Trail. Then I realized after I was halfway down that this was a pretty steep grade. Well let me tell you what I found out, how does 800 ft drop in grade sound to you?? There are two things that don't mix too well, Old men carrying a bag of camera gear and MOUNTAINS!!!! Whew, I am tired, but I feel such a sense of accomplishment. 

Thanks for looking. 

Techy info: Nikon D700 with the battery pack, Nikon 16-35mm f/4 VRII (my 70-200 f/2.8 VR was in my bag, along with 2 spare batteries. It never seems that heavy until you're looking up, and up, and up to see the top of the trail). Thank GOD I have a Benro Travel Angel CF tripod!! Single shot all adjusted in ACR and a splash of NIK thrown in."

2666345285,"Ardea herodias, is a wading bird in the heron family Ardeidae, common over most of North and Central America as well as the West Indies and the Galápagos Islands, except for the far north and deserts and high mountains where there is no water for it to feed in. It is an extremely rare vagrant to Europe, with records from Spain, the Azores and England.

It is the largest North American heron, with a head-to-tail length of 91–137 cm (36-54 in), a wingspan of 180 cm (71 in), and a weight of 2.2–3.6 kg (4.8-8 lbs). It is blue-gray overall, with black flight feathers, red-brown thighs, and a paired red-brown and black stripe up the flanks; the neck is rusty-gray, with black and white streaking down the front; the head is paler, with a nearly white face, and a pair of black plumes running from just above the eye to the back of the head. The feathers on the lower neck are long and plume-like; it also has plumes on the lower back at the start of the breeding season. The bill is dull yellowish, becoming orange briefly at the start of the breeding season, and the lower legs gray, also becoming orangey at the start of the breeding season. Immature birds are duller in color, with a dull blackish-gray crown, and the flank pattern only weakly defined; they have no plumes, and the bill is dull gray-yellow."

I met a pro shooter while taking pics of the sundown and chatting with him he made me stay and try to catch some of the &quot;afterglow&quot; that creates the magical effect.

Sometimes called yellow skunk cabbage, is a plant found in swamps and wet woods, along streams and in other wet areas of the Pacific Northwest, where it is one of the few native species in the arum family, together with the duckweeds.
The plant grows from rhizomes that measure 30 cm or longer, and 2.5 to 5 cm in diameter.
The leaves are the largest of any native plant in the region, 50-135 cm long and 30-80 cm wide when mature.

The plant is called Skunk Cabbage because of the malodorous, distinctive &quot;skunky&quot; odor that it emits.  This odor will permeate the area where the plant grows, and can be detected even in old, dried specimens.  The foul odor attracts its pollinators, scavenging flies and beetles."

This is Castro at night. Fucking beautiful, isnt it?

It was cute to overview the city, with all the small smoke stacks and the palafitos.
At the same time it was quite hard to breathe from time to time, since all those wood-burning stoves created a terribly intensive smoke, that was hardly visible but disgustingly scraping inside my throat.

The night view indemnified me for this though.

&quot;Today’s best estimates are that the figures were carved starting in 1912, by the Italian and German woodworkers at the Herschell–Spillman company’s offshoot, Spillman Engineering Corporation. “Our carousel was one of the last to have had its figures carved completely by hand,” Norling said proudly.


&quot;Having survived repeated floods, and the theft of a figure in the 1970s, the Oaks Park Carousel was last refinished almost forty years ago — and has only been touched up since then. &quot;

&quot;“It hasn’t ever been restored like we did this time,” declared Norling, “Eight of our staff members took it apart to sand and hand-etch away layers of paint – taking each piece down to bare wood. Because they cleaned into the crevasses, you can really see the detail in the horses’ manes and eyes.”

Where necessary, workers repaired broken pieces, blending them in with the original wood, as they restored the historic carousel to its original grandeur.

The Oaks Park Carousel is recorded in the National Register of Historic Places, and is said to be one of only 200 classic carousels remaining in the world.&quot;

Interesting side note~
In carousels all over the world, there has always been the &quot;favorite&quot; animals to ride. This caused problems with small children all wanting a particular horse... So when Walt Disney put his Carousel in Disneyland... He made all the horses &quot;white&quot; to avoid the problem, and get people on faster so they could start the ride. 



 I spent 3 hours yesterday getting to photograph a Carousel here in Portland Oregon, before the amusement park opened.
It was amazing.

I just started a group on Flickr for Pictures of it.

A shot of Jennie standing infront of City Hall. This is <a href=""http://www.modelmayhem.com/1657168"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">Jennie</a>, I met her on Model Mayhem.  Her Model Mayhem Number is: 1657168. 


<b>About the Photo<b></b></b>
*Camera: Canon EOS Digital Rebel XS  *Lens: EF-S 18-55mm ƒ/3.5-5.6 IS  *Shutter Speed: 1/30 Sec.   *Aperture Value: ƒ/5.6   *ISO: 100   *Focal Length: 55mm (80mm Equivalent in 35mm Film)

I shot this on a tripod. To the left of the camera was a bare Canon Speedlite 430EX II pointed at her 4 feet outside of the frame at full power and at 105mm. To the right of the camera was the sun, together these two light sources provided a cross light for the model.

I opened the RAW file in ACR and did my usual tone curve adjustments and exposure corrections. I opened the RAW file in CS4 and saved it as a 16 bit TIFF file and preceded to edit it. I used Scott Kelby's gradient map method of converting to black and white. I added the rain by creating digital noise and bluring it using motion blur and changing the blend mode to screen. I added more rain to the background to give the image a better sense of depth. I added a bit of noise near the model's hands to look like rain drops frozen in the air by flashes. To create the halo of light around the model I duplicated the layer and changed the blend mode to &quot;multiply&quot; and added a mask, then took a large soft brush and removed the layer around the model. I did this a second time but only to the background behind the model to create a further sense of depth to the image. I also selected areas individually and adjusted the contrast of each. I also used the bloat and turbulence tools to slightly change some of the model's proportions. At the end I converted to sRGB colourspace and saved as a JPEG to upload to the internet.

Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary
1:1-11 Faith unites the weak believer to Christ, as really as it does the strong one, and purifies the heart of one as truly as of another; and every sincere believer is by his faith justified in the sight of God. Faith worketh godliness, and produces effects which no other grace in the soul can do. In Christ all fulness dwells, and pardon, peace, grace, and knowledge, and new principles, are thus given through the Holy Spirit. The promises to those who are partakers of a Divine nature, will cause us to inquire whether we are really renewed in the spirit of our minds; let us turn all these promises into prayers for the transforming and purifying grace of the Holy Spirit. The believer must add knowledge to his virtue, increasing acquaintance with the whole truth and will of God. We must add temperance to knowledge; moderation about worldly things; and add to temperance, patience, or cheerful submission to the will of God. Tribulation worketh patience, whereby we bear all calamities and crosses with silence and submission. To patience we must add godliness: this includes the holy affections and dispositions found in the true worshipper of God; with tender affection to all fellow Christians, who are children of the same Father, servants of the same Master, members of the same family, travellers to the same country, heirs of the same inheritance. Wherefore let Christians labour to attain assurance of their calling, and of their election, by believing and well-doing; and thus carefully to endeavour, is a firm argument of the grace and mercy of God, upholding them so that they shall not utterly fall. Those who are diligent in the work of religion, shall have a triumphant entrance into that everlasting kingdom where Christ reigns, and they shall reign with him for ever and ever; and it is in the practice of every good work that we are to expect entrance to heaven.

After innumerable visits to Lal Bagh, finally I went to Cubbon Park on Sunday. It's as important a landmark as Lal bagh in Bangalore but I never preferred going there when Lal Bagh offers so much in terms of photography and family recreational activities (that's mainly walking amidst greenery).

One of the best decisions I have made in relation to this trip was bringing 36 ball-pens with Disney characters with me.  

We gave the pens to the little kids we met on the road during the trip. Many of them are still too young to learn to write, as I was told that they only start going to school at the age of 6. But their joy in receiving the gifts from a total stranger are unspeakable. Some of them immediately tried to draw on their bare palms! Their expressions are priceless and I can only capture them with my camera.

The Story


On our last morning at Myrtle Beach we woke up early and headed down to the beach for sunrise photos, and it did not disappoint.

---------------------------------------------------------
About Myrtle Beach South Carolina
---------------------------------------------------------


Myrtle Beach is a coastal resort city in Horry County, South Carolina, United States. It is the de facto hub of both the Myrtle Beach metropolitan area and the Grand Strand, a complex of beach towns and barrier islands stretching from Little River, South Carolina to Georgetown, South Carolina. Arising from a getaway for lumber workers from Conway, South Carolina, Myrtle Beach has rapidly developed into a major tourist destination in the Southeastern United States.

Der Lusen (tschechisch Luzný) gehört mit seiner Höhe von 1373 Metern nach dem Rachel und dem Arber zu den höheren Bergen im Böhmerwald. Er liegt wie auch der Rachel und der Große Falkenstein im Nationalpark Bayerischer Wald dicht an der Grenze zu Tschechien. 
Das Gipfelkreuz wurde 1947 von der Katholischen Jugend von St. Oswald errichtet und 1992 nach einem Blitzschlag renoviert. Am 17. August 2008 segnete im Rahmen eines Gottesdienstes Diözesanbischof Wilhelm Schraml das Kreuz mit der erst jetzt daran angebrachten Christusfigur, die eine Spende des Bistums Passau ist.

6915052708,"Something about children is just magical. Their willingness to learn, explore, and openly share their experiences is nothing short of extraordinary. This pure joy and freedom is the reason I'm addicted to photographing children. To me, capturing those moments that we lose as we &quot;grow up&quot; is priceless.

With a completely open mind, these children were drawn into a magician's performance. His illusions -- no, not illusions, his MAGIC! -- play into the inner workings of their wonderful imaginations, where  <i>anything</i> is possible. They physically reached out to perform various feats of magic, including disappearing iron balls, changing the very shape and essence of playing cards, teleporting coins, and replicating a red clown nose. This opened their minds to a whole world of possibilities, and as they realized what they were witnessing, the awe and excitement on their faces was <i>real magic</i> in itself.

I hope they never learn the word &quot;illusion&quot;. Magic is real! To me, they are the magicians -- but to them, the entire world around them is filled with places, things, and magical potential just waiting for their exploration :)"

As I asked her right away, if she could spare a minute, she said no pretty quickly. I was kind of dissapointed because I really wanted that shot. But I can understand, if someone does not want to get disturbed by total strangers on the street, even I do it myself if I'm not in the right mood, plus most of the time everyone is looking for your money in the end, one way or the other. So I turned away and ready to go on, as she came back and asked, what I wanted to ask her. Needless to say, that I was very glad, that she came back, and explained her, what I'm doing and if she wanted to be a part of it. Well, she agreed, I made the shot, which I really, really hoped, that would be a good one and thanked her not only for letting me photograph her, but also for coming back and asking once again, this was actually the first time, that happened to me.

Unfortunately, it's getting a bit cold outside, so I won't be able to post new pictures as regulary as I would wish to. So I'm looking forward to spring, so that I have the possibility - regarding available light as well as not-so-freezing temperaturs - to do more portraits."

This took place next to my hostel, and I simply had to take this shot.

Since they took down a whole Telekom lettering from the last letter to the first, the T was the last letter that was rapelled.
I needed to wait for about 45 minutes for that. 

To get this perspective I also had to lay down onto the dirty ground, and I needed to tell the hungarian worker to raise his arms when reaching for the T. Since he did not speak any english, and I do not speak any hungarian, this was quiet complicated.
A lot of effort, but I think the shot is worth it.

The Story
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Yes, much of this is the result of good old-fashoned luck.  True, I did plan to come here because It was raining and it looked like the storm would clear out (moving to the left) just as the sun set.  And I did know that the waves would be of a decent size.  I also knew that the tide would be high and that this time of the year is when light strikes the monolith rock at a slight angle just as the sun sets.

However, I did not know that the pattern in the clouds would line up with the briefly appearing retreating lines of foam.  I did not know that the waves on the right would momentarily appear in front of the newly opened red colored gap in the clouds.  And I did not anticipate that the retreating dark grey clouds moving off to the left would provide some color contrast compared to the otherwise colorful scene.

When you add up all of the randomly appearing elements in this photo, they count for at least half of the total surface area in the frame.  I guess what I'm saying is that no matter how much you plan and think about what you hope to witness, nature is so random that you will always be surprized!  And that is half the fun, don't you think?

6318559836,"Not that I have already obtained all this, or have already been made perfect, but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me.



Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary
3:12-21 This simple dependence and earnestness of soul, were not mentioned as if the apostle had gained the prize, or were already made perfect in the Saviour's likeness. He forgot the things which were behind, so as not to be content with past labours or present measures of grace. He reached forth, stretched himself forward towards his point; expressions showing great concern to become more and more like unto Christ. He who runs a race, must never stop short of the end, but press forward as fast as he can; so those who have heaven in their view, must still press forward to it, in holy desires and hopes, and constant endeavours. Eternal life is the gift of God, but it is in Christ Jesus; through his hand it must come to us, as it is procured for us by him. There is no getting to heaven as our home, but by Christ as our Way. True believers, in seeking this assurance, as well as to glorify him, will seek more nearly to resemble his sufferings and death, by dying to sin, and by crucifying the flesh with its affections and lusts. In these things there is a great difference among real Christians, but all know something of them. Believers make Christ all in all, and set their hearts upon another world. If they differ from one another, and are not of the same judgment in lesser matters, yet they must not judge one another; while they all meet now in Christ, and hope to meet shortly in heaven. Let them join in all the great things in which they are agreed, and wait for further light as to lesser things wherein they differ. The enemies of the cross of Christ mind nothing but their sensual appetites. Sin is the sinner's shame, especially when gloried in. The way of those who mind earthly things, may seem pleasant, but death and hell are at the end of it. If we choose their way, we shall share their end. The life of a Christian is in heaven, where his Head and his home are, and where he hopes to be shortly; he sets his affections upon things above; and where his heart is, there will his conversation be. There is glory kept for the bodies of the saints, in which they will appear at the resurrection. Then the body will be made glorious; not only raised again to life, but raised to great advantage. Observe the power by which this change will be wrought. May we be always prepared for the coming of our Judge; looking to have our vile bodies changed by his Almighty power, and applying to him daily to new-create our souls unto holiness; to deliver us from our enemies, and to employ our bodies and souls as instruments of righteousness in his service.

The Story

Walking around in Oia on the island of santorini during a trip to Greece in October of 2010. We came upon many beautiful spots. It seems like most of the island was made to be photographed. Santorini must be one of the most picturesque places in the world. Every vase, boat, and flower arrangement seems like they were set up for a perfect composition.


---------------------------------------------------------
About Santorini &quot;White and Blue&quot;
---------------------------------------------------------


The most common label that sticks with Santorini is “a classic blue and white”. Even a superficial glimpse at a photo or a video clip from the island will justify Santorini’s unique label. Whether you have never been there or not,  you will recognize Santorini because of its picturesque serene white villages built on the top of high cliffs, cozily embedded between the blue skies and vivid blue sea and spotted by the blue dots of the domed churches.There is no white like Santorini’s white. However the white is the predominant color of all the Cyclades islands, it has a particular nuance in the volcanic island of Santorini. The old inhabitants of the islands chose white for a reason: not only because it has been one of two sacred Greek colors, but because it was also the best contrast to the rocky, green deprived land. In Santorini, somehow, this “cycladic white” got a particular nobless. Santorini’s whites are accentuated by the simple yet amazing architecture. The seemingly endless stairs weave through tiny passages and connect seductively cave-like houses of whitewashed stones, and together melt into the eternal sea of white waves – crisp and shiny in the mornings in the mornings and tamed and laced by departing sun just before the dusk. In the night of the full moon, Santorini white is as mythical and mystical 

---------------------------------------------------------------------
Other stuff
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Oia , (pronounced ee-ya) a tiny village in the north of Santorini, is a postcard come alive. The intense, brilliant whites - the walls and steps, the odd houses that arise in a seemingly haphazard cluster from the sheer volcanic cliffs is a cubist painter's inspiration and delight . Contrasted with the deep azure blue of the sea and the milder sky, its almost surreal, but dazzlingly beautiful.

Anna's Hummingbird is 9-10 cm (3.5&quot;-4&quot;) long. It has a bronze-green back, a pale grey chest and belly, and green flanks. Its bill is long, straight and slender. The adult male has an iridescent crimson-red crown and throat, and a dark, slightly forked tail. Anna's is the only North American hummingbird species with a red crown. Females and juveniles have a green crown, a grey throat with some red marking, a grey chest and belly, and a dark, rounded tail with white tips on the outer feathers.

These birds feed on nectar from flowers using a long extendable tongue. They also consume small spiders and insects which they catch in flight. While collecting nectar, they also assist in plant pollination. They sometimes eat tree sap.

While both sides have valid points (our genetic composition most definitely provides a certain innate disposition), this specific example plays into the claim that our developmental environment shapes us as people. It's no wonder we learn lots from our parents; we spend the first 4 or so years of our lives almost completely in their company. But sometimes the extent to which children learn to mimic their parents in appearance, speech, mannerisms, and skills, is quite amazing.

Clever studies using pairs of identical twins who were adopted into different families, and fraternal twins raised within the same family have shown that in developmental years, one's environment has the largest impact on their personality. However, as we age and our field of communication and experience diversifies, specific environments no longer have the impact they once had. We lose some of the personality we gained from our immediate family environment, and predispositions within our genes begin to take hold, further developing the basis we grew into as children.

Whatever the reason, or mixture thereof, the connection between these two individuals (even without their Mohawks) was instantly visible. All it takes is a single glance to see that they are an inseparable, unstoppable father/son duo."

The palace was built at the end of the 17th century and was greatly expanded during the 18th century. It includes much exotic internal decoration in baroque and rococo styles. A large formal garden surrounded by woodland was constructed behind the palace. 

Das Schloss Charlottenburg wurde in den Jahren 1695 bis 1699 nach Entwürfen des Architekten J. Arnold Nering gebaut. Es war zunächst als ein kleines Garten- und Lustschlösschen für die Gemahlin des Kurfürsten Friedrich III., Sophie Charlotte, gedacht.

Nach der Krönung des Kurfürsten im Jahre 1701 zum ersten König in Preußen wurde das Schloss durch den Architekten Eosander v. Göthe zu einem mehr repräsentativen Sitz nach Versailler Vorbild ausgebaut. Der zentrale Mittelbau mit seinen elf Fensterachsen wurde nun durch Seitenflügel ergänzt und es entstand ein Cour d´honneur, ein Ehrenhof. Auch kam in dieser Phase das wohl charakteristischste Bauelement des Schlosses hinzu, die etwas zu groß geratene Kuppel.

Prague ( /ˈprɑːɡ/; Czech: Praha pronounced [ˈpraɦa] ( listen)) is the capital and largest city of the Czech Republic. Situated in the north-west of the country on the Vltava river, the city is home to about 1.3 million people, while its metropolitan area is estimated to have a population of over 2.3 million. The city has a temperate oceanic climate with warm summers and chilly winters.
Prague has been a political, cultural and economic centre of Europe and particularly central Europe during its 1,100 year existence. For centuries, during the Gothic and Renaissance eras, Prague was the permanent seat of two Holy Roman Emperors and thus was also the capital of the Holy Roman Empire. Later it was an important city in the Habsburg Monarchy and the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and after World War I became the capital of Czechoslovakia. The city played major roles in the Protestant Reformation, the Thirty Years' War, and in 20th-century history, during both World Wars and the post-war Communist era.
Prague is home to a number of famous cultural attractions, many of which survived the violence and destruction of twentieth century Europe. Main attractions include the following: Prague Castle, the Charles Bridge, Old Town Square, the Jewish Quarter, the Lennon Wall, and Petřín hill. Since 1992, the extensive historic centre of Prague has been included in the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites.
Prague boasts more than ten major museums, along with countless theatres, galleries, cinemas, and other historical exhibits. Also, Prague is home to a wide range of public and private schools, including the famous Charles University. Its rich history makes it a popular tourist destination, and the city receives more than 4.1 million international visitors annually, as of 2009. Prague is classified as a global city.
A modern public transportation system connects the city. Prague is also accessible by road, train, and air.


About Charles Bridge:

The Charles Bridge (Czech: Karlův most  listen (help·info)) is a famous historic bridge that crosses the Vltava river in Prague, Czech Republic. Its construction started in 1357 under the auspices of King Charles IV, and finished in the beginning of the 15th century. As the only means of crossing the river Vltava (Moldau) until 1841, the Charles Bridge was the most important connection between Prague Castle and the city's Old Town and adjacent areas. This &quot;solid-land&quot; connection made Prague important as a trade route between Eastern and Western Europe. The bridge was originally called the Stone Bridge (Kamenný most) or the Prague Bridge (Pražský most) but has been the &quot;Charles Bridge&quot; since 1870.
The bridge is 516 meters long and nearly 10 meters wide, resting on 16 arches shielded by ice guards. It is protected by three bridge towers, two of them on the Lesser Quarter side and the third one on the Old Town side. The Old Town bridge tower is often considered to be one of the most astonishing civil gothic-style buildings in the world. The bridge is decorated by a continuous alley of 30 statues and statuaries, most of them baroque-style, originally erected around 1700 but now all replaced by replicas.
During the night the Charles Bridge is a quiet place. But during the day it changes its face into a very busy place, with painters, owners of kiosks and other traders alongside numerous tourists crossing the bridge.

A quiet day with a inconspicuous sunset is ending. My camera I´ve but a desire to take pictures did not really. I´m sitting alone on 'Lake Starnberg' (German: 'Starnberger See'), near 'St. Heinrich' on a landing stage. No wind, no people, no ships, every now and again a fish jumps out of the water. It is very nice but also very lonely today so I´ve time to ponder about the life. 
This is truly a beautiful place, but somehow I´m dissatisfied with something and I´ll not stay today. So I stand on the landing stage go back and explore this theme and ask myself how old is this great tree? Stay short.. do just this only one picture. Then I think: 'Life Is Only For Awhile' and I´m going away... Do you take the time to pass the time to leave?

Been a while since I've taken a Stranger photo!
Went to Hollywood Blvd today and took the good'ol camera and the awesome lovely girlfriend to enjoy some street life if that makes any sense!

Walking down the great street of Hollywood Blvd, I noticed Lorenzo drumming away on his snare. I went up to him, gave him a dollar, then asked if I could take a few shots and he had agreed! He had some awesome energy, and didn't feel awkward in front of the camera. I then asked his name, and he had said he was called Lorenzo.

After I had finished taking the photos, he asked,
&quot;What's your name man&quot;?
I told him it was Jonny.
&quot;Where you from brother?&quot;
I'm from Panorama City, I had told him.

He then starts drumming away singing, &quot;Jonny from Panorama City! Jonny from Panorama City!&quot; 

Like I said, awesome energy and all-around great guy! I gave him many thanks then I walked away, hearing him singing 'my song' which he had made on the spot xD

This was one of the best experiences of my life, thanks to the MIT flying club, and my good friend Jeremy for convincing me to take the trip. We took off, we bounced around..and we flew like a feather drifting across turbulent wind! Since I have a few photos from the trip that I like I decided to make a series.

yosemite is, in my opinion, as close to &quot;heaven&quot; as i'll ever experience. i've been there before, but the spring was a whole new shade -- literally and figuratively -- of yosemite. mirror lake (above) is virtually nonexistent in summer &amp; autumn; it is simply sand beds. late winter and spring, however, there is a still lake that perfectly mirrors the immense landscape... which, here, includes a piece of half dome. (i have other shots of half dome in mirror lake that i'll upload at some point!) ansel adams famously captured much of yosemite's beauty, but as any photographer knows, light and weather conditions are never the same twice. no matter how many times el cap or half dome or glacier point or tunnel view has been photographed, there is always room for variation."

&quot;<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow""><b>SHADHINOTA </b></a> is My Cause for the 40th Celebration of BANGLADESH Independence. The land, the mighty rivers and the natural beauty makes Bangladesh a land of unparalleled splendor and magnificence. Bangladesh was liberated after a prolonged war of Independence the declaration of which was given on 26th MARCH 1971. One of the worst genocides <a href=""http://www.genocidebangladesh.org/"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow""><b> Genocide</b></a> in history took place at the behest of an autocratic regime in the name of Political stability spearheaded by the then Pakistan President <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_Khan"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow""><b> Yah ya Khan</b></a>. After 9 months of Liberation water and the sacrifice of 3 million lives Victory came. In addition to the loss of lives countless others were rendered homeless, the infrastructure including roads and bridges and factories lay in ruins. The people of Bangladesh have shown time and again how resilient they are. After each and every disaster, natural or man-made the people have again stood up and started all over again from scratch.
My Effort here is to pay tribute to the valiant sons of the soil and the ‘die hard’ attitude of a people who can still smile in the face of adversity however great it may be. I plan to make a collage of images that represent the lives of the people of Bangladesh. I encourage you to upload a photo each day till I have a total of 40 images for the Cause <b>SHADHINOTA in the group<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/groups/1536473@N22/""> Frame BANGLADESH</a></b>&quot;

I passed that house every week for the past 5 years, waiting for it to bloom again, but it never did.  Until this year.  And there were 5 stalks.  Hope you enjoy them as much as I have.

Uncle Vanya from Maminsky has got these little broiler chickens at his home. They sat in a plywood box with a table lamp inside and ran back and forth, squeaking thinly.

This must have been somewhere between AZ and UT. I remember us leaving Mexican Hat, where we stayed for the night. Almost a ghost town with a couple Motels and a gas station left. We stayed at the Mexican Hat Lodge &amp; Swinging Steak. Well, the steak was the worst I've ever had and probably also the most expensive. For one of us to eat, the other one had to use the menu to get rid of a gazillion flies. But those are the kind of memories, that stick to your mind and those turn out to the be truly funny moments, that make a road trip a road trip I guess. 

The landscape around this area is amazing and I feel that only very few people actually travel through here. Most take the short take at Lake Powell and don't bother to drive all the way around it to get the Capital Reef National Park.

The shot was taken with a Nikon D60, hand-held and manual exposure mode. Post processing in Aperture as always. There is no mystery about taking good photos - being at the right spot at the right time is still the most important thing."

4777723431,"Every summer I go to Northern Michigan to vacation with my family.  I was really excited to go this time to find some strangers for my project outside of Maryland.  While we were there, we visited Harbor Springs on a Thursday evening for Musique in the Streets.  Musicians play in designated areas all over the city for free every Thursday during the summer.  

I found myself taking tons of pictures of the' Poor Richards' because I really liked their sound.  They did a lot of cover songs but with their own twist.  I decided that I was going to ask their guitar player if I could use him for the project when they took a break from playing.  During one of their songs the singer stopped and asked me if I was from the area and if I was shooting for a paper.  I explained that I wasn't a professional and that I live in Baltimore now.  The guitar player said, &quot;oh, you're living in Bawlmer.&quot;  It was then that I knew that my first Michigan stranger was actually a Marylander.  Anyone that pronounces Baltimore that way is definitely from the state of Maryland.  See, people always know that I'm from out of town because I still pronounce the sound of every letter in my lovely city's name.  

I decide that this guy was too cool to pass up, though.  So, this is Rocky.  Rocky was born in Guantanamo Bay but grew up, and still lives in Annapolis, Maryland.  He also vacations in Michigan during the summertime to meet up with his band.  They have been playing together since 1960. When they first started playing they had gigs on a regular basis.  Now that they are older and live all over the country they usually only get together once a year.  It was so nice to meet Rocky and hear the band play.  It made for a wonderful Thursday night in Northern Michigan.

Los caballitos del diablo, como el resto de odonatos, son hemimetábolos (metamorfosis incompleta) y su estadio ninfal es acuático. La hembra pone huevos en el agua, a veces en la vegetación sumergida, o en lo alto en árboles, en cavidades que reciben agua de lluvia. Las ninfas son carnívoras, comiendo larvas de mosquitos, Daphnia, y otros organismos acuáticos.

Las branquias de las ninfas son grandes y externas, al final del abdomen. Después de un tiempo importante en la metamorfosis, el adulto emerge y come moscas, mosquitos, y otros insectos pequeños. Algunas especies tropicales grandes se alimentan de arañas.

Recently I have a huge lack of time and maybe also a small lack of creativity. This is why I haven’t uploaded so many pictures the last months. 
But as in the last weeks a lot of friends really forced me to go on and upload photos again, I decided to take something from the archives and here you see it.

This is from my trip to the glorious city of New York. The shot has been taken in the taxi. It was more a spontaneous one but I love the amount of floating lines one can see there.
Hope all of you are creative and produce more of your lovely shots.

Any recommendations from your Streams? Feel free to post the Link I want to see what I have missed the last months!!!

Ever since seeing Jim's awesome <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/jimpatterson/4122555276/"">image</a> of Davenport (and being inspired by other great shots, like <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/lswenger/5198659867/"">Lukas'</a>) I've been itching to get my own photo of the &quot;fingers&quot; at Davenport Beach.  Unfortunately the swell prevented me from getting close enough to the rocks to really show their fingery shape.  So although I couldn't achieve my exact vision for what I wanted to capture here, the amazing light, color, and reflections were too beautiful to pass up.

I also met <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/57078694@N04/"">Yan</a> out there.  An extremely nice and enthusiastic photographer!

Tech Notes on this Photo
-----------------------------------

Nikon D300s
Tokina 12-24 mm
ISO200 - I chose ISO200 for a couple of reasons, the main being that I wanted to keep my shutter speed in the ~2 second range; bumping the ISO to 200 helped me do that.  ISO200 also has the highest dynamic response on the D300, so shooting here gives me less of a problem clipping highlights or shadows
f/8 - the sharpest spot on my lens and it helps me defocus scratches, drops, and dust on my filters/lens.  Also, it was getting quite dark so the relatively wide aperture allowed me to keep my shutter speed at point where I could show some flow to the water.
2.5 sec
12 mm on a crop sensor
Lee 3-stop and 2-stop soft GND Filters, handheld at a very slight angle to help darken the horizon on the left.

Post-Processing 
----------------------
In Raw Converter (Nikon Capture NX2)
- Processed single raw file four times: once for the sky, once with a +1 green tint for the foreground to remove excess magenta cast there, once with a +0.3 ev to blend in some brighter water near the horizon, and once with a -0.3 ev and the saturation dialed down to pull some detail back into the extremely saturated horizon
- Global contrast for added pop
- Slightly darkened and added contrast to the sky to add oomph
- Slightly brightened and added contrast to foreground rocks
- Local contrast adjustments to increase shine on the rocks
- straightened horizon by a tiny amount

In Photoshop:
- Noise reduction via Neat Image
- Gradient blend between sky and foreground tiffs
- Hand blend in of brighter water and darker sky tiffs
- Selective sharpening of foreground rocks
- Dark darks luminosity mask with subtle levels adjustment to even out detail and exposure in the seastack
- Extensive cloning on seastack to remove excess light blurring caused by smears on my filters

Thanks for looking!

The Story
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

It has been a strange winter with lots of clear skies but strangely, lots of rain too.  The storms are coming in fast, dumping a ton of rain and then quickly clearing out before sunrise or sunset. So unfortunately, the light has been rather boring most of the time this winter rainy season in California. I try to 'stock up' on good images that will last me through the dry summer months when the clouds evaporate, but pickings have been slim. March is the end of the rainy season so there is still hope that over the next few weeks, we will have some dramatic skies. There can occasionally be good clouds after that but the odds decrease until November.

Fortunately on this morning, the clouds stuck around for a dramatic sunrise and then were gone about an hour after I saw this view. I live across the bay about 20 miles (30km) away on the left side of this picture behind Angel Island. So I only go here when there is a decent chance of good light. 

I chose a short exposure time here because there were these cloloful ripples in the water and no wind to mess them up. This place has great long-exposure potential as you may have see in other views from here. And I used a wide angle to take in as much as I could. It was so dramatic and the weather was mild and humid. I almost forgot to take the shot!

The map shows the exact location.

2) Sometime the confetti doesn't spread and swirl and it lands in clumps. With a thud. Since it's just paper, it doesn't hurt, but it can surprise you. (A couple clumps hit my lens while I was <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/superamit/80103265/in/photostream/"">shooting up</a>.)"

Introspection -- looking through life's natural mirror at your inner self -- can yield a world of things you didn't know about yourself, or didn't know you could do.

As this girl approached the glass overlooking the Ice Palace in West Edmonton Mall, she stopped suddenly in her tracks, drew a coy expression, and grabbed tightly onto her dad's arm. There was *no way* she was going anywhere near the glass. She was convinced she'd fall right through, onto the ice below!

After her dad coached her through a little introspective session consisting of some challenges she's overcome in the past, the girl was willing to, with her dad's assurance, reach forward and touch the glass. It took a few attempts, but when she did it she turned around, screamed, smiled at him, and then ran to her mom, who was just coming out of a store. She relayed all that I've just told you (in a slightly more excited and condensed fashion, mind you :P) much to the approval of her mother.

By realizing all that she's done in the past, she was able to overcome a fear, and learned that she could do something she never dreamed of doing before. I know that the next time *I* face a challenge, this girl will be the first thing I think of, and I'll whole-heartedly take her advice: I'll think back through my past to find something that proves I can overcome the challenge."

Story:
---------------------------------------------------------

There are many great photographic vantage points in San Francisco. So when I'm there for a sunset,it is really hard to choose from the vast and comprehensive menu! Parking can be a bit of a challenge though, even at night.

The only difficult thing about making this picture were the sea lions that were constantly swimming by making patterns in the water. Even on these 30-second exposures, the patterns are obvious and can spoil the smooth reflections. So I waited for the wakes to calm down and shot between them since I only get about 4 minutes where the moonlight, sunset light and city lights are even. There was also a human swimmer but when he saw me he courteously stayed away with the sea lions circling him. They seem to be friendly.

Actually there is one long sea lion trail that is just below the boat in the center. I'll mark it with a note. And if you ever go to San Francisco, try the Ghirardelli Chocolate!

The map shows exactly where this is.  It was taken from the Municipal pier at the end of Van Ness Ave.

The sun was dazzling and the sky was a yummy blue, causing the lake to explode in those insane shades of azure it's so famous for.  I sat in awe on a rock, dangling my camera and precious new 10mm lens a few centimeters off the water, trying my best to capture to awesome beauty just casually lapping against the rocks.  The clouds in the sky create a fun mirror to the waves.

This is on a little turnout on the road right before Sand Harbor, requiring a little bit of a bushwhack to get to the rocks.

The polarizer really shows uneven polarization here, but I like it.  77mm causes some interesting effects.  I needed it badly though--there was a lot of glare to cut.  The 10mm lens and its slight &quot;fish&quot; cause the underwater look in the foreground.

6874267569,"Galveston Island Park sprawls across a relict hurricane wash-over fan about half way along the island between Galveston and San Louis Pass on the west end. When La Salle discovered the island, it was inhabited with a group of natives that called themselves Carancahuas. The water that you see on the right is called Carancahua Cove.

The park was established after a planned development of the land went bankrupt and as you can see, the marsh is slowly re-establishing itself. Each Hurricane washes beach sand inland over the fan helping to erase the earlier development disruptions. The island was at a near equilibrium with sand being deposited on the beach and then moved inland via the fans into the back-bay. These fans are slowly subsiding into the marsh and are replenished by the storms washing more beach sands to keep the fan barely above water. Of course, modern development has disrupted this process and the island may be entering a new period where it will move slowly landward, retreating due to the lack of new sand input.

A new winter storm was moving in from the west and the high cirrus clouds helped make the sunset very vivid and colorful.

Nighttime shot of Hong Kong Island and Tsim Sha Tsui from the Victoria Peak.

This was a difficult shot to take, especially since I did not have a tripod with me. The best vantage point was the edge of the Peak Tower viewing platform, but the wide guardrail there was sloping, not flat. I had to balance the camera on a bag set on that rail, support the bag with one arm without touching the camera (or breathing much) and trigger the shutter via remote control with the other. I took about 30 shots at various shutter speeds and focal lengths, but this is the one I am  most happy with.

Bridal Veil falls in Yosemite flows year-round, but in the spring it flows at its maximum rate as the high elevation snow melts.  I moved around to find an opening in the trees to show as much of the falls as possible.  Even though this was taken at the touristy 'Valley View' side-of-the-road pullout, you can still be creative and move around to get the best composition that you can.  I've seen literally thousands of pictures taken from within 50 feet of this spot and have not seen this sort of image made.  Also there were other photographers there with expensive tripods taking shots from vantage points that barely showed the waterfall at all.  Did they even notice what they were shooting?  They also had long lenses and were not including much if any of the water.  But the water was an important part of the scene.

I waited for the last rays of the sun to light up the cliffs and waterfall.  Then I made many exposures ranging from 1/4-second to 30 seconds with a dark filter to try to get the best effect in the water.  I settled on this 2-second exposure because it showed the most reflectivity and still have nice texture so the viewer can visualize the water flowing by.  I always try to adjust the exposure time to add realism.  Sometimes the best is short and sometimes long.

The map shows exactly where this is.  It is a 20-foot hike from the nearest road.   lol!

<b>Saarbrücken </b> is the capital of the state of Saarland in Germany. The city sits at the heart of a metropolitan area that bounds westwards to Dillingen and northeastwards to Neunkirchen, in which most of the people of the Saarland live.

Saarbrücken used to be the industrial and transport centre of a great coal basin; factories here produced iron and steel, sugar, beer, pottery, optical instruments, machinery, and construction materials. However, over the past decades the industrial importance of Saarland has declined, as it is much cheaper, even for German companies, to import coal from lower-wage countries instead of buying it here.

Historic landmarks in the city include the stone bridge across the Saar (1546), the Gothic church of St Arnual, the 18th century Saarbrücker Schloss (castle) and the old part of the town, the St. Johanner Markt. In 1815 Saarbrücken came under Prussian control, and for two periods in the 20th century (1919–35 and 1945–57) it became part of the Saar territory under French administration. For this reason, coupled with its proximity to the French border, it retains a certain French influence.

In modern German Saarbrücken literally means Saar bridges, and indeed there are about a dozen bridges across the Saar river. However the name actually predates any bridge at this spot by at least 500 years[citation needed]. The historical name of the town is actually Sarabrucca, derived from the Old High German word Brucca, which became Brocken in High German (rocks or boulders in English)

Ideally I would like to get the reflections all the way across the shot and they are cut off by the hill in this shot... Lastly the exposure and processing need a little bit of work as well, but here is my progress so far, I call it ying-yang because this represents the green nature of the emerald city as well as the life and electricity of the city itself in perfect balance with one another.

Oia Santorini: Oia, pronounced ‘Ia’, is the most famous of all villages of Santorini. It is known throughout the world for its quiet life and fantastic sunset, and is certainly the most beautiful and picturesque village of Santorini.

The village is also situated on top of an impressive cliff and offers a spectacular view over the volcano of Palia and Nea Kameni and the island of Thirassia.
Oia is situated on the north of the island, 11 km away from Fira. 
 
It is a traditional village with charming houses in narrow streets, blue domed churches, and sun-bathed verandas. Its streets have plenty of tourist shops, taverns, cafés, and other shops. 

Oia has several cultural attractions like the Maritime Museum which houses a small library, items from the maritime life of the area, and the vestiges of a Venetian fortress.

Many artists fell in love with the area and settled there. For that reason, the village of Oia has many art galleries.

Oia also has a small port, Ammoudi, which can be reached by a set of 300 steps leading down. There, small boats can take you opposite, to the island of Thirassia. The beach of Armenis is also located there. Taverns in Oia offer visitors tasty meals of fresh fish.

Santorini -The naked child

Bend if you can to the dark sea forgetting 
the flute's sound on naked feet 
that trod your sleep in the other, the sunken life. 

Write if you can on your last shell 
the day the place the name 
and fling it into the sea so that it sinks.

We found ourselves naked on the pumice stone 
watching the rising islands 
watching the red islands sink 
into their sleep, into our sleep. 
Here we found ourselves naked, holding 
the scales that tipped toward injustice. 

Instep of power, unshadowed will, considered love, 
projects that ripen in the midday sun, 
course of fate with a young hand 
slapping the shoulder; 
in the land that was scattered, that can't resist, 
in the land that was once our land 
the islands, --rust and ash-- are sinking.

Altars destroyed 
and friends forgotten 
leaves of the palm tree in mud.

Let your hands go traveling if you can 
here on time's curve with the ship 
that touched the horizon. 
When the dice struck the flagstone 
when the lance struck the breast-plate 
when the eye recognized the stranger 
and love went dry 
in punctured souls; 
when looking round you see 
feet harvested everywhere 
dead hands everywhere 
eyes darkened everywhere; 
when you can't any longer choose 
even the death you wanted as your own-- 
hearing a cry, 
even the wolf's cry, 
your due: 
let your hands go traveling if you can 
free yourself from unfaithful time 
and sink-- 
So sinks whoever raises the great stones.

Most people think this shot was taken on my Hasselbad Xpan but it was actually taken on my trusty old Canon EOS 50 &amp; 24mm using Ultra 50. It was taken on the 31st of December 2001. It is my first film panorama! I saw it printed as a panorama by accident, a guy I worked with selected 4x10 instead of 4x6 as the print print size. Thanks Jason!"

About Valentines day:
Do we need a day for love? We can debate for ours, but it  is a fact this consumer world has an influence on us. And we all love to be a part of celebrations. So we like days like Valentines day or Love. Here comes another Feb 14th.
So why, when and where this Valentines day started?
It all started with Saint Valentine. The saint of Love.

Valentine's Day  is an annual commemoration held on February 14 celebrating love and affection between intimate companions. It is traditionally a day on which lovers express their love for each other by presenting flowers, offering confectionery, and sending greeting cards (known as &quot;valentines&quot;). The day first became associated with romantic love in the circle of Geoffrey Chaucer in the High Middle Ages, when the tradition of courtly love flourished.

4823417144,"La etimología del nombre “Capri” deriva del latín caprae (cabras), no del gringo kapros (jabalí), aunque en la isla se hayan encontrado muchos restos fósiles de este animal, la isla, habitada desde el paleolítico – época en que estaba unida a la tierra firme - , fue en principio griega y después romana. Augusto, al visitarla en el 29 a.C., fue el primero que edificó una villa en la misma.

Su sucesor, Tiberio, vivió en ella desde el 27 hasta el 37 d.C. Después de Tiberio, otros emperadores vivieron en Capri y hasta el s. IV d.C. fue visitada y habitada por nobles romanos. Una vez caído el Imperio Romano de Occidente, la isla formó parte durante algún tempo del Ducado de Nápoles. En el s. VI sufrió las incursiones sarracenas y en los siguientes, el dominio de los lombardos, normandos, angevinos, aragoneses y al final de los españoles.

En los s. XVII y XVIII, la isla pasó por un nuevo periodo de fortuna, al unísono con el gran florecimiento político y artístico de Nápoles, gracias a una activa diócesis y a los privilegios restaurados por los españoles y por los Borbones.

Esto está avalado por la estupenda arquitectura de Iglesias y conventos que se pueden admirar en los dos centros urbanos. A partir de la segunda mitad del s. XVIII, muchos de los viajeros que descendían cada vez con mayor frequencia desde la Europa septentrional, atraídos por el sol y en busca de un mundo mítico primitivo, incluyeron Capri en sus itinerarios.

Sus calles son tan pequeñas que tienen camiones diminutos para llevar la mercancía. Es muy interesante adentrarse por sus estrechas calles, eso sí, ponte  a la cola de los turistas...

The 60,000 m² park has a clear and modern design featuring two large sloping lawns, distinctive plant and tree groupings, and paths at different levels that allow for several different views of Berlin’s new city center. Especially popular with Berliners and foreign guests alike is the panorama walkway between Moltke, Heinemann and Kronprinzen Bridges. Bars and deck chairs invite passers-by to enjoy the atmosphere along the Spree River. The park is also part of a long-term plan to make the entire bank of Spree River from Spandau to Köpenick available for public use.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fences are designed to split things apart; to divide ownership between two entities. However, fences also have the added effect of creating a challenge. For some people, sneaking through a broken fence or over pain-inducing barbed wire just for the adrenaline boost that follows breaking onto private property seems to be the result of said challenge.

Freerunners revel at the sight of a high fence that they can scale, run on top of, or jump over -- it's just one more obstacle in the array of objects they must conquer to reach the finish. In some traditional sports, a fence provides the same adrenaline boost. Volleyball, tennis, and badminton players train to achieve the fastest, hardest, and most effective smashing techniques to intimidate the opponents lining the other side of the &quot;fence&quot; between them.

Wherever you can find a fence, and whatever shape that fence may take, you can be sure that someone will see in that fence a challenge of sorts. I saw this challenge in a fence once, and after that ordeal, the earth had more skin on it than my face did. Concrete is hard! ;)"

<strong><u>About</u></strong>

This is my third upload from our trip to Paris last weekend.

I'm sure there are thousands of shots to be found of this glass pyramid &amp; the Louvre, so I think I've pulled off a couple of interesting angles of this but I'm not sure they haven't been done before.

<strong><u>The shot</u></strong>

Single shot in RAW/ISO100 at f/14 using the Sigma 10-20mm lens on a tripod ( of course ) using a remote to start and stop the exposure.

There are actually always walking way too many people around here, but using these long expsoures ( 100 seconds here ) that problem solves itself, as long as people don't muck about in the same place for more than a second or 5 there is no real problem.

<strong><u>Adobe Camera Raw</u></strong>

° A little less exposure.
° A little extra contrast.
° Extra clarity.
° Some extra saturation.

<strong><u>Photoshop</u></strong>

° A small hue change to give it a slightly warmer tone.
° A small amount of dodging on the water reflection.

<strong><u>You</u></strong>

All comments, criticism and tips for improvements are ( as always ) welcome.

The Story
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This was the view just as the sun touched the horizon at Hapuna Beach as the volcanic fog (vog) from Kilauea moved in on the left side of the frame.  The vog turned the lower part of the sky a surreal shade of very light red compared to the usual blue you would normally see.  I made sure to capture the sand at the most reflective moment to bring even more of the sky into the picture.  Other than that, there was little drama involved here.  In fact, it was so relaxing and perfect that I had to remind myself that I was shooting!

I showed this in the back of the camera to a curious person standing behind me.  He said, &quot;Wow, I didn't see that!&quot;  That was an unexpected response since he was right there.  I think that he missed this reflective moment while staring directly at the sunset instead of noticing everything.  Photos can capture what a video or a direct experience can miss.  The lesson here is to never forget that fact when you are out shooting!

Processing was super-easy.  I left the colors alone other than selecting the reds in the sky and de-saturating them a bit to bring out more of the fine detail.  It took about 2 minutes to create a TIFF file!  Usually it takes about 10 minutes.

Information from the last upload:  Hapuna beach is often rated as the #1 beach in the US, with perfect weather year-round, perfect sand and a water temperature of about 77 (25c) year round.  Not too hot or too cold ever.  The beach gets about 5 inches (12cm) of rain per year.  It is a state park, so access is easy.  It is also a great place to watch the sunset.  Although rain clouds are blocked by the twin 14,000 ft (4300m) volcanos Mauna Loa and Mauna Kea, clouds and volcanic fog ('vog') still wrap around them creating lots of thick atmosphere for dramatic sunsets.

This was a rather annoying shot to take, since the bridge would keep vibrating from the heavy traffic, and I would end up with ugly, blurry pictures.

Scotland

We woke on this morning in Torridon to drenching rain and overcast skies. Instead of hiking, we decided to take the drive to Inverness and get some shopping done to restock our self catering supplies. After spending a few hours there hoping for the weather to clear, we headed back up towards Torridon and stopped by the roadside for a snooze. As we woke, we saw the sky starting to clear and rushed off to Beinn Eighe. As we reached the viewpoint, we realised that the better views were from lower down and rushed back to this spot we had spotted on the way up. Loch Maree was incredibly still at this point and later on, mist would flow down the valleys across the loch. Truly beautiful spot, but walking back in the dark from up here was a little scary.

Morning Glory Pool is located in the Upper Geyser Basin and it’s probably the best known of its pools. According to a park brochure, the long favored destination for visitors was named for its remarkable likeness to its namesake flower. Unfortunately, this previously vibrant blue pool has fallen victim to vandalism; people have thrown tons of coins and other debris into the pool. Much of it had become embedded in its side and vent reducing water circulation and resulting in lower water temperatures. These lower temperatures have in turn led to the orange and yellow thermophiles that now thrive.
The color of the geothermal pools is determined by the heat-loving organisms that thrive in these boiling waters. The hottest waters give rise to thermophiles that produce the color blue while progressively cooler waters (relatively speaking) give rise to greens, yellows, red, browns and finally black. This rainbow of colors is particularly prominent in the pool overflow paths where the gradation of these colors may be seen as the waters get further away from their source of heat. An example of this may be seen at the edge of the pool and toward the top of this image where the overflow water winds its way into the woods.   
If one looks around the periphery of the clearing one can see that the trees have been heavily damaged. This is due to the extremely high temperature and acidity of the geothermal water which will eventually kill the trees.

6419305189,"The unfolding of your words gives light; it gives understanding to the simple. - Psalm 119:130 (NIV)


Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary
119:129-136 The wonders of redeeming love will fix the heart in adoration of them. The Scriptures show us what we were, what we are, and what we shall be. They show us the mercy and the justice of the Lord, the joys of heaven, and the pains of hell. Thus they give to the simple, in a few days, understanding of those matters, which philosophers for ages sought in vain. The believer, wearied with the cares of life and his conflicts with sin, pants for the consolations conveyed to him by means of the sacred word. And every one may pray, Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name. We must beg that the Holy Spirit would order our steps. The dominion of sin is to be dreaded and prayed against by every one. The oppression of men is often more than flesh and blood can bear; and He who knoweth our frame, will not refuse to remove it in answer to the prayers of his people. Whatever obscurity may appear as to the faith of the Old Testament believers, their confidence at the throne of grace can only be explained by their having obtained more distinct views of gospel privileges, through the sacrifices and services of their law, than is generally imagined. Go to the same place, plead the name and merits of Jesus, and you will not, you cannot plead in vain. Commonly, where there is a gracious heart, there is a weeping eye. Accept, O Lord, the tears our blessed Redeemer shed in the days of his flesh, for us who should weep for our brethren or ourselves.

En este lugar está una de las atracciones principales del país, que es el castillo de la isla, que está dentro del Lago Galvé.

La construcción de este castillo comenzó en el siglo catorce y continuó hasta el siguiente, haciendo uno de los sitios favoritos para las visitas de muchos. Este castillo fue uno de los principales durante las épocas del Gran Ducado de Lituania y durante algunas décadas tuvo una importancia estratégica tanto en el país como en la región, y en la actualidad mantiene su ambiente de la realeza y hace parte de un paisaje impresionante.

El Castillo en el lago en Trakai es considerado por muchos como el orgullo del país, siendo el único de su especie que está ubicado en una isla en toda Europa Oriental. Este tesoro de la arquitectura, que es llamado en ocasiones como el Pequeño Marienburg debido a su gran parecido con el castillo que se encuentra en la ciudad polaca de Malbork, ha pasado por grandes reconstrucciones a través de los siglos.

A picture of the well-known &quot;Julehuset&quot; (Christmas House) on Drosselvej in Roskilde, Denmark. 

Taken with a Hasselblad SWC/M camera with 38mm Zeiss Biogon lens on Fuji Superia 100 film. The negatives were scanned on a Hasselblad / Imacon 848 scanner. The original file is about 7000 pixels wide.

This photo is my first attempt at pseudo-HDR by manually blending several exposures using masking and layers in Photoshop CS3. The Christmas decorations on the house varied quite widely in intensity, so I took three separate exposures at f/11 (1/8th, 1/2, 2 seconds). I also took a fourth exposure of 30 seconds in order to capture lots of detail in the darker house, some of this detail was blended in on a separate layer at very low opacity (around 20%) in order to keep that house quite dark, which is a true reflection of what the scene looked like.

Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary
1:26-38 We have here an account of the mother of our Lord; though we are not to pray to her, yet we ought to praise God for her. Christ must be born miraculously. The angel's address means only, Hail, thou that art the especially chosen and favoured of the Most High, to attain the honour Jewish mothers have so long desired. This wondrous salutation and appearance troubled Mary. The angel then assured her that she had found favour with God, and would become the mother of a son whose name she should call Jesus, the Son of the Highest, one in a nature and perfection with the Lord God. JESUS! the name that refreshes the fainting spirits of humbled sinners; sweet to speak and sweet to hear, Jesus, a Saviour! We know not his riches and our own poverty, therefore we run not to him; we perceive not that we are lost and perishing, therefore a Saviour is a word of little relish. Were we convinced of the huge mass of guilt that lies upon us, and the wrath that hangs over us for it, ready to fall upon us, it would be our continual thought, Is the Saviour mine? And that we might find him so, we should trample on all that hinders our way to him. Mary's reply to the angel was the language of faith and humble admiration, and she asked no sign for the confirming her faith. Without controversy, great was the mystery of godliness, God manifest in the flesh, 1Ti 3:16. Christ's human nature must be produced so, as it was fit that should be which was to be taken into union with the Divine nature. And we must, as Mary here, guide our desires by the word of God. In all conflicts, let us remember that with God nothing is impossible; and as we read and hear his promises, let us turn them into prayers, Behold the willing servant of the Lord; let it be unto me according to thy word.

I went back to the old rail yard that I was at last week. The sky was clear, but there was an amazing amount of light pollution from the shunting yard next door, an amazing amount. 

I had heard about hobo's who spend nights in old rail cars. These two Ball's of light must be old drop outs, but they certainly lit up a dull old place.

Merry Christmas you lot, have fun and be safe!

The rock pinnacles, or hoodoos, which the monument was primarily created to protect, are erosional features composed of welded rhyolite tuff, which is volcanic in nature.

A “Wonderland of Rocks” is waiting for you to explore at Chiricahua National Monument. This forest of rock spires was eroded from layers of ash deposited by the Turkey Creek Volcano eruption 27 million years ago. The 8 mile paved scenic drive and 18 miles of day-use hiking trails provide opportunities to discover the beauty, natural sounds, and inhabitants of this 11,985 acre site. Visit the Faraway Ranch Historic District to discover more about the people who have called this area home: Chiricahua Apaches, Buffalo Soldiers, Erickson and Stafford families.

Chiricahua National Monument is a unit of the National Park Service. The monument is located approximately 36 miles (58 km) southeast of Willcox, Arizona. It preserves the remains of an immense volcanic eruption that shook the region some 27 million years ago. Called the Turkey Creek Caldera eruption, it eventually laid down two thousand feet of ash and pumice, highly siliceous in nature. This eventually hardened into rhyolite tuffs, and eroded into the natural features visible at the monument today.

6719142123,"Sunset over frozen Tenaya Lake, Yosemite National Park.

This Sierra Nevada winter has been off to a wildly slow start. This is the first time the Tioga Road, Hwy 120, has been open through the Yosemite high country in many decades. Radio stations all over California have been advising the masses to visit Yosemite before this weekend's storms roll in since viewing and photographing these conditions may be a <b>once-in-a-lifetime opportunity</b>.

So, what exactly are these <b>unique conditions</b>? It's winter, and all lakes above 5000 feet have long <b>frozen</b> over. But there's <b>almost no snow</b> on the neighboring peaks, forests, and other surroundings. When I drove up to Tenaya Lake, there must have been a hundred people scattered all over its surface: kids <b>ice skating</b>, full-grown adults gliding around on beach chairs... it was quite a sight!

Because of these unique conditions, lots of amazing photographers (Josh Cripps, Willie Huang/inter211, Aaron M/Leftquark, Jim Patterson, etc.) have flocked to the area, each producing jaw-dropping images of the frozen lake at sunset. Search flickr and you'll surely notice one thing, though: every image is so immensely different! The multitude of <b>cracks, air bubbles, and icebergs</b> really do present limitless photographic opportunities; I was running all over this area capturing verticals and horizontals, alpenglow and post-sunset purple, reflections and icebergs...that evening really was <b>special</b>.

As for the clouds -- there were awesome lenticulars ALL day that decided to burn off just an hour or two before sunset. Then some nice altocumulus began to roll in, looking quite promising, but they too burned off. This is all we had, but I think it was enough. 

The light changed so much over the hour I spent shooting that my toughest decision was which shot to post first! This one's actually just <i>before</i> sunset; what you see is strong sunset light, not true alpenglow, on the domes. I chose this time because the sky was still blue and I really liked how it complimented the blue in the ice. I do have vertical comps as well, but by now you've probably seen a couple verticals, so here's a horizontal to show you both sides of the lake.

Heavy snow, which will finally close the road, is forecast for this weekend.

Have a good one!

I posted two abstract shots in a row??  What is this world coming to?  Truth be told, I'm not much of an abstract shooter.  I just love grand vistas and soaring landscapes.  But sand dunes are such amazing studies in lines, light, color, and textures that it's easy to lose yourself in these elements.  The way that light and shadow feather so perfectly around the curves of the dunes is pure magic.  The smoothness and subtleties can be so perfect they almost look like they were painted in.

It's fair to say I was in photographer heaven at these pristine, gorgeous dunes in southern Death Valley.  Can't wait to teach our workshop here in November!

While driving from Launceston to St Helen’s in the North of Tasmania, the road took us through the beautiful scenery of the blue tiers region. We didn’t have much time so we randomly picked one spot to stop. The walk to Halls Falls is a relatively short one and well worth it. I took this shot from the middle of the river since the path only allows a side on view to these very rapidly flowing falls.

This is a link to a video made of stills and HD video taken on our recent trip:

Ellos son cultivados para elaborar mermeladas caseras y otros productos de esta índole.
Este poblado se ubicaba en el Camino de Inca, por lo que se sabe que por aquí pasó el descubridor de Chile, Diego de Almagro, lugar que luego sería de asentamiento para los españoles. Es así como la mayoría de las viviendas, locales de comercio e iglesias datan de esa época.
En Pica se ubica la Iglesia de San Andrés y corresponde a la tercera construida en el mismo lugar, desde el año 1600. Posee aguas termales y es visitado por una gran cantidad de turistas, desde Pica yo me traigo a mi ciudad la rica pulpa de mango para hacer tragos y jugos"

The current Bodie Island lighthouse is the third that has stood in this vicinity of North Carolina. The first two actually stood south of Oregon Inlet on Pea Island. The first was built in 1847 and then abandoned in 1859 due to a poor foundation. The second, built in 1859, was destroyed in 1861 by retreating Confederate troops who feared it would be used as a Union observation post during the Civil War. The third and current lighthouse, with its first order Fresnel lens, was completed in 1872.

While some people (including North Carolinians not from the Outer Banks) pronounce the name with a long &quot;o&quot; sound, it is traditionally pronounced as body. This is derived from the original name of the area, which was &quot;Bodies Island&quot;, due to the number of dead sailors washed ashore from this portion of the Atlantic Ocean, which is known as the Graveyard of the Atlantic. Local gift shops sell maps of the shipwrecks on the ocean floor. An impressive array of ships have been sunk due to storms, shoals, or even German U-boats in World War II.

The dam is 44 meter high and has a length of 180 meter and was built between 1954 and 1959. 

Der Sylvensteinspeicher ist ein fjordartiger Stausee im Isarwinkel südlich von Lenggries an der Straße von Bad Tölz zum Achensee, der 1954 bis 1959 für den Hochwasserschutz im Isartal gebaut wurde. 

Die Höhe des Damms selbst beträgt 44 m, die Länge seiner Dammkrone 180 m. Der Damm staut neben der Isar auch deren Seitenzuflüsse Dürrach und Walchen auf. 

Der Stausee wurde nach einer natürlichen Engstelle im oberen Isartal, dem Sylvenstein, benannt und ist mit seiner imposanten Brücke ein häufig abgebildetes Motiv vor der alpinen Bergkulisse des Karwendelgebirges. Im See versunken liegt das ehemalige Dorf Fall, welches vor der Flutung abgerissen und einige Dutzend Meter höher an der Straße nach Vorderriß neu erbaut wurde.

Der Leuchtturm Westerheversand ist ein See-, Quermarken- und Leitfeuer. Die Feuerhöhe beträgt 41 Meter, die Bauwerkshöhe 40 Meter. Die Tragweite des Lichts ist rund 21 Seemeilen (etwa 39 Kilometer). Die indirekte Sichtbarkeit des Lichtscheins beträgt bis über 55 Kilometer. Bei klarer Sicht ist er noch auf Helgoland auszumachen.

Der Turm wurde 1906 auf Westerheversand rund 1.000 Meter vor dem Seedeich auf einer vier Meter hoch aufgeschütteten Warft mit Pfahlgründung (127 dicke, lange Eichenpfähle) und Betonsockel errichtet. Montiert wurde der Turm aus 608 miteinander verschraubten, insgesamt 130 Tonnen schweren gusseisernen Platten, sogenannten Tübbings, auf einem gemauerten Sockel. Die Eisenplatten stammten aus der Isselburger Hütte im Münsterland. Innerhalb des Turmes befinden sich neun Stockwerke. Auf beiden Seiten des Turms wurden Leuchtturmwärterhäuser errichtet.

6863928382,
2853827987,"The area pictured here is known as the Isthmus. It's in Olympia, Washington and it's widely regarded, if not commonly regarded, as a sacred space. It is the heart of Olympia. It is where the fresh water of the Deschutes River, which originates from a glacier upon the majestic slopes of Mount Rainier, meets the deep waters of Budd Inlet and the Puget Sound - and eventually the Pacific Ocean and the World Ocean.

This area symbolizes the connection that exists between Olympia and the World. Olympia is a world city - it is known for looking past the conflicts that plaque the federal government and taking steps to make the world a better place to live, all on its own.

I envision a park in this space. A monument to citizen engagement. A monument to the societal and city relationship with the world - and with nature.

The park would serve the people in many ways. It would provide for recreation. It would provide an avenue for education about the environment, about ecology and sustainability. It would also attract people to downtown - as residents, as visitors, as investors.

Olympia has a lot of novel features. It is a novel city in many respects. A park feature on the isthmus would only improve these aspects.

Part of my vision, and I think it is shared amongst a considerable population of Olympia residents, is for a dense urban core juxtaposed with an open park area, to include areas that would be semi-wilderness, as well as more traditional recreational features: walking trails, playgrounds, fields for games, etc.

Imagine: 15,000 more people living AND working downtown. People living within walking, bicycling or wheel chair distance to their work place. New schools. New businesses.

A park feature on the isthmus is the perfect opportunity to initiate that process. A park feature, and the denial of a proposed rezone, is the perfect way to begin to move toward a vision of true, functional, sustainability.

I won't let Triway, the developer who has proposed the rezone in an effort to allow the construction of a gigantic building that would be full of an estimated 141 luxury condominiums, badger me or threatren me with the prospect of a low-rise office building (given the denial of the rezone proposal.)

I know what I want. I think that I know what would best serve the community. I know that the public interest outranks and trumps private interests, especially in matters that involve zoning."

<strong>Description &amp; Photographer Notes:</strong>
On Day 2 of the cruise, the ship was at see.  There were lots to do onboard (e.g. lectures, gambling, etc), but nothing was that intriguing.  Lost a few bucks at the casino and ended up teaching a photography lecture to some first timers and their digital cameras.  The only thing I could do, well, was to walk around and take more photos of the ship!

The helicopter pad, pretty much standard on all cruise ships these days, can be found on Deck 5 on the <em>Radiance of the Seas</em>.  I’ll eventually post a few pictures taken from the helicopter pad."

I couldn't see a damn thing but the clouds, and it was gray all over), so I went back the next day in the afternoon with two other photo enthusiast friends and we got a break this time.

It was a fine winter afternoon with a clear sky and subtle pink on the horizon. The Chesapeake bay was painted blue, the moon went up early, and I was a happy man. In case you're wondering, the tiny red spot on the horizontal line is Shoal Lighthouse. There's more to come, so stay tuned.

To prepare the game, I matched the color of select items around tenoversix’s courtyard to paint chips, like the ones you get at home depot. I then precisely cut the paint chips to match parts of the items I selected, thereby camouflaging the paint chip pieces.  When people arrived at the opening, they were instructed to go out into the courtyard and find the little paint chip bits.  When someone found one, they were instructed to bring it to me.  Then, I would redeem it for one of the gifts my mom gave me this past Christmas. The gifts have never been open, so it was a big surprise to use both. 

If you would me to set up Hidden Paintchip Fancy Gift at one of your parties, please feel free to contact me at marc (at) ineedtostopsoon (dot) com, and we can work something out.

They can be inviting
But some are altogether
Mighty frightening

As we die, both you and I
With my head in my hands

<b>Bicicleta </b>

La bicicleta es un vehículo de transporte personal propulsada por el propio viajero, cuyos componentes básicos son dos ruedas, generalmente de igual diámetro y dispuestas en línea, un sistema de transmisión a pedales, un cuadro metálico que le da la estructura e integra los componentes, un manillar para controlar la dirección y un sillín para sentarse. El desplazamiento se obtiene al girar con las piernas la caja de los pedales que a través de una cadena hace girar un piñón que a su vez hace girar la rueda trasera sobre el pavimento. El diseño y configuración básica de la bicicleta ha cambiado poco desde el primer modelo de transmisión de cadena desarrollado alrededor de1885.
La paternidad de la bicicleta se le atribuye al barón Carl von Drais, inventor alemán. Su rudimentario artefacto, creado alrededor de 1817, se impulsaba apoyando los pies alternativamente sobre el suelo.
Existen diversas modalidades deportivas, englobadas dentro del ciclismo, que se practican con este vehículo.
Introducida en el siglo XIX en Europa, tuvo un impacto considerable en la historia, tanto en la cultura como en la industria. En la actualidad hay alrededor de 800 millones de bicicletas en el mundo (la mayor parte de ellas en China), bien como medio de transporte principal o bien como vehículo de ocio.
Es un medio de transporte sano, ecológico, sostenible y muy económico, tanto para trasladarse por ciudad como por zonas rurales. Su uso está generalizado en casi toda Europa, siendo en países como Holanda, Suiza, Alemania, algunas zonas de Polonia y los países escandinavos uno de los principales medios de transporte. En Asia, especialmente en China y la India, es el principal medio de transporte.
En España las primeras bicicletas se empezaron a construir a principios del siglo XX, fundamentalmente en Éibar (Guipúzcoa). Muchas empresas, como Orbea, BH, G.A.C. etc., se habían dedicado en sus inicios a fabricar armas de fuego.


<b>Historia

Antecedentes de la bicicleta moderna </b>

En el Antiguo Egipto se fabricaron artefactos rudimentarios compuestos por dos ruedas unidas por una barra. También en China un artilugio muy similar, pero con ruedas hechas de bambú. En la cultura azteca, se han encontrado vestigios de lo que podría ser algo parecido a un vehículo con dos ruedas y que se impulsaba con un velamen. Las primeras noticias que se tienen sobre una bicicleta datan del año 1490, aproximadamente, en la obra Codex Atlanticus, de Leonardo da Vinci. En ellos puede verse un boceto de una bicicleta con transmisión de cadena impulsada por unos pedales, mismo método empleado por las actuales.
En 1790 el conde francés Mede de Sivrac habría inventado en París el «celerífero», al que también se llama «caballo de ruedas». Consiste en un listón de madera, terminado en una cabeza de león, de dragón o de ciervo, y montado sobre dos ruedas. No tiene articulación alguna, y para las maniobras hay que echar pie a tierra; esa misma rigidez hacía que todas las variaciones del terreno repercutieran sobre el cuerpo de su montura.

<b>La draisiana </b>

En 1817, el barón alemán Karl Christian Ludwig Drais von Sauerbronn inventó el primer vehículo de dos ruedas, al que llamó máquina andante (en alemán, laufmaschine), precursora de la bicicleta y la motocicleta. Esta «máquina andante» consistía en una especie de carrito de dos ruedas, colocadas una detrás de otra, y un manillar. La persona se mantenía sentada sobre una pequeña montura, colocada en el centro de un pequeño marco de madera. Para moverse, empujaba alternativamente con el pie izquierdo y el derecho hacia adelante, en forma parecida al movimiento de un patinador. Con este impulso, el vehículo adquiría una velocidad casi idéntica a la de un coche. Sus brazos descansaban sobre un apoyabrazos de hierro, y con las manos sostenía una vara de madera, unida a la rueda delantera, que giraba en la dirección hacia la cual quería ir el conductor.
Este invento estaba basado en la idea de que una persona, al caminar, desperdicia mucha fuerza por tener que desplazar su peso en forma alternada de un pie al otro. Drais logró crear este sencillo vehículo que le permitió al hombre evitar ese trabajo. Esta máquina, denominada inicialmente draisiana en honor a su inventor y posteriormente llamada más comúnmentevelocípedo, evolucionó rápidamente.

<b>La bicicleta de pedales </b>

La construcción de la primera bicicleta con pedales se atribuye al escocés Kirkpatrick Macmillan, en el año 1839. Una copia de la bicicleta de Macmillan se exhibe en el Museo de Ciencias en Londres, Inglaterra. Macmillan nunca patentó el invento, que posteriormente fue copiado en1846 por Gavin Dalzell de Lesmahagow, quien lo difundió tan ampliamente que fue considerado durante cincuenta años el inventor de la bicicleta.
Cerca de 1890, el inglés John Boyd Dunlop (aficionado al ciclismo y creador de la empresa homónima) inventó una cámara de tela y caucho, que se inflaba con aire y se colocaba en la llanta. Para evitar pinchazos, Dunlop inventó además una cubierta también de caucho. Estos inventos de Dunlop casi no han sufrido variaciones significativas desde su invención.

Much better big on black!  Press L

If you weren't in California last weekend you missed out on quite possibly the nicest day the world has ever seen.  At the coast it was 75°, sunny, and a warm, off-shore breeze was blowing.  A perfect day for being outside.  I went for a bike ride along the coast and couldn't keep a smile off my face.  

As the afternoon wound down, clouds began to build to the west.  I finished my bike ride and texted a few friends with this development.  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/19224593@N04/"">Jave</a> wrote me back and said that he and <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/alanchanphotography/"">Alan</a> were already out at Davenport Main Beach getting ready to shoot.  'Damn, that's where I shot last night,' I thought to myself.  Oh well, it's always fun hanging with other photogs, so I zipped up to Davenport to find not only Jave and Alan (who were battling mist whilst shooting the Davenport Crack), but about 7 other photographers out trying to catch the sunset over the stack.  Because I didn't want to get in anyone's frame I couldn't get as close to the Davenport fingers as I would have liked, so I sloshed off by myself to the north and found just about the simplest composition imaginable.  I have a number of variations of this shot, but in the end I like this one the best for the rich colors and the way the seastack reflection is ghostly in the ocean swirls.

Nikon D300s
Tokina 12-24 mm
ISO100 - To help lengthen the shutter speed while still using a relatively wide aperture
f/8 - the sharpest spot on my lens and it helps me defocus scratches, drops, and dust on my filters/lens.   
3 seconds for lots of flow
12 mm on a crop sensor
Lee 3-stop and 2-stop soft GND Filters, handheld at a very slight angle to help darken the horizon on the right.

Post-Processing 
----------------------
In Raw Converter (Nikon Capture NX2)
- Processed single raw file once
- Global contrast for added pop
- Added contrast to the sky and slightly brightened the upper part of the sky
- Slightly increased brightness and greatly increased contrast of foreground water in order to bring out water streaks and reflections
- straightened horizon by a tiny amount

In Photoshop:
- Noise reduction via Neat Image
- Curves layer to add small amount of global brightness and contrast
- Curves layer to further remove vignetting around edges of image

6147604582,"Boneyard Beach at Botany Bay
Charleston County, South Carolina
Accessed via Botany Bay Road on Edisto Island

This is another shot that I cleaned up awhile back from my sunrise shoot with Dave and Jen Allen at the Boneyard Beach at the Botany Bay Plantation Wildlife Preserve in the lowcountry of South Carolina.  I thought there were a few elements of interest in this shot...the most interesting to me being the convergence of the three smaller waves in the foreground and the placement in the frame as it relates to the reflection, horizon, and silhouetted tree.  Although the initial thought was to capture wave action with longer exposures in the foreground, a lack of filters and plenty of early dawn light forced me to adapt and change the approach.

This property was acquired by the South Carolina Department of Natural Resources in 2008 and opened to the public.  Located near the North Edisto River, Botany Bay and the Boneyard Beach are part of the Ashepoo, Combahee, and South Edisto (ACE) basin, one of the largest undeveloped estuaries on the East Coast consisting of over 350,000 acres of diverse habitats.  I wish I could get back to this location for more photography--although I'm unsure if the remaining trees in the shore came out whole after the recent hurricane and storms.

3322752430,"A sundog (scientific name parhelion, for &quot;beside the sun&quot;) is a common bright circular spot on a solar halo. It is an atmospheric optical phenomenon primarily associated with the reflection or refraction of sunlight by small ice crystals making up cirrus or cirrostratus clouds.

See here another, clearer shot of an sundog, taken last year in Raisting, Germany: 
<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/c-s-n/2744345098/"">www.flickr.com/photos/c-s-n/2744345098/</a>

Sundogs oder Nebensonnen habe ich bisher leider noch nicht häufig gesehen... genau genommen ist diese hier, die nicht besonders stark ist, erst die zweite. Eine sehr viel deutlichere (weil bei Sonnenuntergang) habe ich vergangenes Jahr in Raisting aufgenommen (siehe Link oben). 

Nebensonnen sind Haloerscheinungen die in einem Abstand von rund 22° links oder rechts, manchmal auch beidseitig, neben der Sonne auftreten. Es erscheint dabei so, als ob sich neben der Sonne eine zweite, schwächere befinden würde. Der wissenschaftliche Name einer Nebensonne ist Parhelion. Die englische Sprache bezeichnet sie sehr fantasievoll als sundog (Sonnenhund). Die Bezeichnung spiegelt die Tatsache wider, dass Nebensonnen sich immer an der Seite der Sonne befinden. 

Hervorgerufen wird diese Erscheinung durch dünne Wolken von Eiskristallen. Jeder dieser Kristalle stellt ein natürliches hexagonales Prisma dar. Das weiße Sonnenlicht tritt an einer Seite der hexagonalen Eisprismen ein und an der übernächsten Seite aus. Beim Ein- und Austritt wird das Licht in einem genau definierten Winkel gebrochen. Kristalle, die vom Standpunkt eines Beobachters aus eben diesen Winkelabstand zur Sonne aufweisen, lenken ihr Licht auf den Beobachter, und er sieht einen kreisförmigen Halo um die Sonne. Da der Brechungswinkel für jede Wellenlänge verschieden ist, ist das Licht zudem in die Farben des Regenbogens aufgespalten (Chromatische Dispersion). Zur Entstehung einer Nebensonne ist zusätzlich eine sehr geringe Luftbewegung in der Wolke erforderlich.

Spring is coming to a close here in Northern Virginia.  The trees have lost their color and are filling in with more mature, darker greens.  The ephemerals have come and gone, crowded out by the burgeoning, sun-hungry leaf canopies above.  The tulips around Washington D.C. have hung on just about as long as they can and are finally losing their petals to the wind and rain, leaving behind only empty stalks and faded memories of what will have to wait another twelve months to show again.  The District was surprisingly beautiful during the Spring months this year--the Azalea bloom was absolutely amazing and the tulips around the monuments were an added bonus and jolt of color for photography and viewing.  The past few months have been an exercise in running near and far to capture as much of Spring as possible before Summer takes over and my schedule can slow a bit.  The good news is a relatively large archive of pictures to work through and share on Flickr!

The Netherlands Carillon is a 50-bell structure given by the people of the Netherlands in 1954 for aid received during World War II.  The Carillon is the heaviest of all musical instruments, with the Netherlands Carillon in Arlington, Virginia weighing in at roughly twenty-eight metric tons.  The greatest concentration of Carillons can be found in the Netherlands where these musical bell-towers are considered a symbol of civic pride and status.  In America, in my personal experience, you are most likely to find Carillons on college campuses.  In addition to the Carillon, a relatively large tulip library is planted each year on the lawn--the other tulip library is located between the Washington Monument and the Jefferson Monument on the banks of the Potomac River Tidal Basin.  Tulips comprise the largest part of the total Spring planting in the National Capital Parks, with imported tulips from the Netherlands hand-planted each November."

I will be fly to Munich tonight and act in a stupid german law show tomorrow.
I got this job through an audition I did about 2 years ago, and even though its a stupid afternoon show, I am really proud to do it.
I love film, I always love being on film sets, and this time I will even have my personal 2 minutes of fame. AND I get the chance to spend a day in Munich for free.

What could be better?!

I will update you about how the shooting went. And hopefully I will have some nice Munich shots with me when flying back tomorrow night!

A bit of open ice along the Parker Head Road in Phippsburg reflecting the clouds above...  I wish I'd had a wider lens with me to include the stairs going into the water (stepping back meant standing in the middle of the road).  Also, I typically don't mind grind and grain, but I would have liked this cleaner.  I won't have my C41 processing done at the drug store again.  ...need to just figure out how to do it myself.  Still, it's Jimi Hendrix trippy cool to my eyes.

Wikipedia:
El parc natural del Penyagolosa s'extèn per els termes municipals de Vistabella del Maestrat, Vilafermosa i Xodos en el Massís del Penyagolosa a la província de Castelló. Aquest paratge de 1.094,45 hectàrees fou declarat parc natural per la Generalitat Valenciana el 7 d'abril de 2006.L'origen del topònim Penyagolosa (Peñagolosa en la zona de l'Alt Millars) es perd en el temps, però pareix que procedeix de l'evolució del terme pinna (muntanya) i lucosa (boscós), segons resen alguns documents com el relatiu a la donació de Culla a l'ordre del Temple en 1213.
Existeixen multitut de vestigis dels pobles que romaren i passaren per aques lloc; així es localitzen pobles d'íbers, restes de calçades romanes i sobretot s'aprecien signes manifest del despoblament actual, pel que es tradueix en una pèrdua de valor cultural i històric del conjunt territorial.
L'Ermitori de Sant Joan de Penyagolosa, està integrat per un conjunt arquitectònic d'estil neoclàssic amb origen en el segle XIV, encara que la Cofradia de Sant Joan data del segle XVII. Tots els anys es celebren event amb centre en el Santuari, el més conegut dels quals és l'antiga romeria de Els Pelegrins de les Useres, que se celebra cada últim divendres d'abril.
No menys important és el patrimoni construit vinculat al medi rural tradicional, centrat en els masos i edificacions relacionades, del qual el conjunt poseeïx un gran valor històric i cultural.És un dels mites geogràfics del País Valencià, convertit en símbol de les terres agrestes de l'interior en agut contrast amb les planures litorals i les valls. Representa un mite en la geografia del País Valencià i un referent cultural arrelat molt profundament en la tradició valenciana. Amb els 1.813 metres, es tracta de la segona cima del País Valencià, només lleugerament superada pel Alto de las Barracas, en el Javalambre valencià del Racó d'Ademús. Es caracteritza per una orografia molt abrupta, sobretot en la vertent asomada al mar Mediterrani, dominant les fortes pendents, amb angosts i profunds barrancs llaurats sobre els floraments calcàreus predominants.
El Massís de Penyagolosa presenta importants aspectes geològics, tals com l'interesant seqüència estratigràfica, representativa de bona part del període Cretàcic, i els notables traços estructurals i geomorfològics. Entre aquests últims destaquen formes típiques de periglaciarisme, així com espectaculars formacions kàrstiques com el Poldjé de Vistabella, el Canyó del riu Montlleó, el riu Carbo i distintes coves d'interès.
El Massís se sitúa en el forcall entre ambients biogeogràfics molts diversos. El seu caràcter de transició entre l'interior i la costa, i també entre els secotr norteny i meridional del País Valencià, propicia una extraordinaria diversitat de flora i fauna. Aquest riquesa queda acrecentada per la forta impronta paisatgística dels espessos boscs de les rostàries en contrast amb els rasos de les cimes.

El Parque Natural del Peñagolosa (Penyagolosa en valenciano), es un paraje en torno al macizo del mismo nombre, que ocupa una superfície de 1.094'45 ha, localizado entre los términos municipales de Vistabella del Maestrazgo, Villahermosa del Río, y Chodos, (en el interior de la provincia de Castellón).El origen del topónimo Peñagolosa, se pierde en el tiempo, pero parece que procede de la evolución metatética del término pinna (montaña) y lucosa (boscoso), según rezan algunos documentos como el relativo a la donación de Culla a la Orden del Temple en 1213.

Representa un hito de la geografía y el referente cultural arraigado muy profundamente en la tradición valenciana. Con sus 1.814 metros, se trata de la segunda cima de la Comunidad Valenciana, sólo ligeramente superada por el Cerro Calderón, en el Javalambre valenciano del Rincón de Ademuz. Se caracteriza por una orografía abrupta, sobre todo en la vertiente asomada al mar Mediterráneo, dominando las fuertes pendientes, con angostos y profundos barrancos labrados sobre los afloramientos calizos predominantes.

This scene was what greeted us at the end of a night of star gazing and shooting. There was intermittent fog passing through the island on a very cold summer night ( 8 degrees rising to 36!) which gave rise to some incredible rising mist around Hanson Bay and the nearby lagoon. I'm glad I took the long weekend off to go shooting with Keith &amp; Amy !

I love this shot even though the quality may not be perfect.

This shot was somehow coincidential, I set the camera up and started the 2 second selftimer in AEB mode. At first the parents of this girl stood there with her, but as soon as the third and longest exposure started they walked away and left this girl alone in the frame.
I just could not believe how lucky I was.
The whole lighting, her eyes, the umbrella, its just like a movie still for me.

A movie still from the movie of my personal paris visit. Its a good movie.

I was sure that I would get the best view of the city from there. Initially, I just wanted to see the area and scout for the famous 'secret' spot on top of the Bay Bridge tunnel. However, when I got there, I couldn't just leave without at least taking a couple of shots. Between the trees and the unlit street, I couldn't see any button on the camera and I was shooting blind! Eventhough I mostly shoot at night, I usually have my cell phone with me to assist me finding the right buttons in complete darkness, but I couldn't do it that night! (Shortly afterwards, I bought a small flash light and dropped it in my camera bag for situations like this!) I know I have to go there again, this location deserves a lot more than this. 

I have taken other shots from this location, down by the sea front, and from the SF sea front. I will share these shots with you in the next couple of days. They are definitely inspired by the great photographers here in flickr that have been there before me. 

The results of my first night 'literary' in San Francisco. I hope you enjoy viewing it as much as I enjoyed capturing it.

6842453871,"well, it was challenging to take the shot the way it appears above. first of all, my dream was to capture day-time long exposure. easy ha!! not really, since it's the middle of the day! the light is too bright for long exposures. and here the 'Vari ND filter' come over to solve the problem by cutting the lights entering the lens by 2-10 stops max. for this specific shot, I think i set it around 6 stops.
the polarizing filter was attached to the lens as well, that cuts 2 more stops! so we're cutting the light by 8 stops in total.. great...

well, there is another issue! the sky becomes over exposed easily with long exposures!
ummm the Grad ND filter comes to place now! i can't remember witch Grad ND i fitted at that time, ND4 or ND8!! but it did the job perfectly by shading the left top corner and reserved the details of the clouds nicely, that without the filter will be blown out...

This is in total allowed me to stretch the exposure to 8 seconds.. 

but lots of objects could move in 8 seconds! well that's true and that's why i spent like 2 hours shooting hoping less objects move in the frame each time, luckily, the main subject in the frame (the girl) is almost as sharp as i hoped! 

Have a nice Day.. :D

The Naval Air Station Alameda was constructed on landfill at the west end of Alameda Island in the early 1930s. The land was acquired from the Army Air Corps in 1936 and construction ensued on the naval air station. Most of the buildings were all designed at the same time in what I call Government Deco. NAS Alameda was closed in 1996 and sat mostly vacant for 10 years. The City of Alameda has entered into a partnership with SunCal Companies for the redevelopment of this important piece of naval history.

It does not appear that NAS Alameda is on the National Register."

Believe me, it is beautiful and it touches my heart every time I see a photo of it. In these white Cherry Blossoms there is so much peace I really don’t know how to explain it. For me they just symbolize quietness, peace, rest and security. So good God created them as beautiful as they are.

In Germany we say “Ist das mit Perwoll gewaschen?” if something is really clean. I always imagine a huge washing machine cleaning all these blossoms. But baahh I don’t want to bother you with my fairy tales. I can tell these to my kids and grandkids later in life :)

I hope you like the photo as much as I do and get inspired to dream about how beautiful nature is.

If you are like me than you have things to do all of your time… But I want to encourage you today, take 5 minutes, or if you have no time at all, just looks at the little amenities you can find outside of the internet and your computer. This will surely make your day easier!

Have fun

I Just had to take a photo of a dreaded dandelion in my yard.  Obviously I caught this one on a day with minimal wind(unusual in or neck of the woods).  I was impressed by the perfection and spacing of the seeds.  Upon further inspection, they really are quite beautiful and so delicate.  Seconds later the seeds were windborne and off to plant more dandelions.  This process truly is one of the many marvels of nature.  Have a great weekend and take a close look at what is right under your lens.

Although Cannobio is a small municipality of 5600 inhabitants it is developed on an area of 51 square kilometres.
Cannobio is well equipped, like all other towns on lake Maggiore, to welcome the tourist in a quiet and relaxing environment, with its beach, playground for the kids, and excellent itineraries for bikers.
For the art lovers there is the collegiate church of Saint Vittore of the XVIII century, the church of Saint Marta of the XVI century, and the sanctuary of the Piety of the XVI century.
The town of Cannobio is located at the edge of the Cannobina valley, that is cut through by the beautiful Torrent Cannobino that forms the famous gorge of Saint Anna.
From the Cannobina valley is possible to cut across reaching the Vigezzo valley, the valley of the Painters.

<b>Sutro Baths</b>
Point Lobos Ave &amp; Merrie Way
San Francisco, CA 94121
(415) 561-4323 
<a href=""http://www.sutrobaths.com/"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">www.sutrobaths.com/</a>

The Sutro Baths were a large privately owned swimming pool complex in San Francisco, California built in the late 19th century. The building housing the baths burned down in 1966 and was abandoned. The ruins may still be visited.

On March 14, 1896 the Sutro Baths were opened to the public as the world's largest indoor swimming pool establishment. The Baths were built on the sleepy western side of San Francisco by wealthy entrepreneur and former mayor of San Francisco (1894-1896), Adolph Sutro. The vast glass, iron, wood, and reinforced concrete structure was mostly hidden, and filled a small beach inlet below the Cliff House, also owned by Adolph Sutro at the time. Both the Cliff House and the former Baths site are now a part of the Golden Gate National Recreation Area and operated by the United States National Park Service. The site was filmed in 1903 by American Mutoscope and Biograph Company, offering an extraordinary view of the Cliff House from the beach below, available from the Library of Congress online.

A visitor to the Baths not only had a choice of 7 different swimming pools—one fresh water and six salt water baths ranging in temperatures—but could visit a museum displaying Sutro's large and varied personal collection of artifacts from his travels, a concert hall, seating for 8,000, and, at one time, an ice skating rink. During high tides, water would flow directly into the pools from the nearby ocean, recycling the 2 million US gallons (7,600 m³) of water in about an hour. During low tides, a powerful turbine water pump, built inside a cave at sea level, could be switched on from a control room and could fill the tanks at a rate of 6,000 US gallons a minute (380 L/s), recycling all the water in five hours.

The baths were once serviced by a rail line, the Ferries and Cliff House Railroad, which ran along the cliffs of Lands End overlooking the Golden Gate. The route ran from the baths to a terminal at California Street and Central Avenue (now Presidio Avenue). The line was filmed in 1902 by Thomas Edison, Inc., available from the Library of Congress online.

The baths struggled for years, mostly due to the very high operating and maintenance costs, and eventually closed. A fire destroyed the building in 1966 shortly after, while in the process of being demolished. All that remains of the site are concrete walls, blocked off stairs and passageways, and a tunnel with a deep crevice in the middle. The Sutro Bath ruins are open to the public, but a warning sign advises strict caution, as visitors have been swept off by large waves and drowned at the site.

Currently, visitors coming to the Sutro Baths from the above parking lot are presented with a sign that describes the history of Sutro Baths starting from its construction and glamorous opening to the public in 1896. Another sign describes the later years of the site's history up until its demolition and complete destruction by fire in 1966. As one walks up out of the ruins toward the historic Cliff House, home to two full service restaurants: &quot;Sutro’s at the Cliff House&quot; and &quot;The Bistro&quot;, as well as the &quot;Terrace Room&quot;, a private Dining/reception room, one can find other pictures, paintings, and relics from the golden age of Sutro Baths’ functional operation.

Seal Rock is just offshore from the bath ruins."

The following quote is from the Blue Ridge Heritage website: &quot;Devil's Courthouse may have received its name because of the sinister aspect of the rock formation, or because, as legend holds, the devil held court in the cave that lies beneath the rock. In Cherokee lore, this cave is the private dancing chamber and dwelling place of the slant-eyed giant, Judaculla.&quot;

You may have heard that the nickname for the city Jaipur is &quot;Pink City&quot; and it's not for no reason. The buildings in the main streets of this city were all painted pink since 1800s.

This boy was cooking for a gang of beggars sitting behind him (about 50 people I think). Everyone gets a chapati and a curry dipping and they ate them on the street.

It was sunset time and I was feeling hungry when I saw the chapati... Indian makes really good bread!

the photo was taken by my Sigma's 70-300mm f4-5.6 @ 119mm
the aperture  was set to f8 and ISO speed set to 100.
the shutter speed was 0.002 sec (1/500) very fast . . . due to the brightness of sun!! plus i set the exposure to -2EV,, to give the sun and the clouds more attention. that caused the foreground to look much darker and so made the shot stunning.. . .

6412023757,"Looking for that blessed hope, and the glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ; - Titus 2:13 (AKJV)



Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary
2:11-15 The doctrine of grace and salvation by the gospel, is for all ranks and conditions of men. It teaches to forsake sin; to have no more to do with it. An earthly, sensual conversation suits not a heavenly calling. It teaches to make conscience of that which is good. We must look to God in Christ, as the object of our hope and worship. A gospel conversation must be a godly conversation. See our duty in a very few words; denying ungodliness and worldly lusts, living soberly, righteously, and godly, notwithstanding all snares, temptations, corrupt examples, ill usage, and what remains of sin in the believer's heart, with all their hinderances. It teaches to look for the glories of another world. At, and in, the glorious appearing of Christ, the blessed hope of Christians will be complete: To bring us to holiness and happiness was the end of Christ's death. Jesus Christ, that great God and our Saviour, who saves not only as God, much less as Man alone; but as God-man, two natures in one person. He loved us, and gave himself for us; and what can we do less than love and give up ourselves to him! Redemption from sin and sanctification of the nature go together, and make a peculiar people unto God, free from guilt and condemnation, and purified by the Holy Spirit. All Scripture is profitable. Here is what will furnish for all parts of duty, and the right discharge of them. Let us inquire whether our whole dependence is placed upon that grace which saves the lost, pardons the guilty, and sanctifies the unclean. And the further we are removed from boasting of fancied good works, or trusting in them, so that we glory in Christ alone, the more zealous shall we be to abound in real good works.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Another year has come and gone, and now that we've all celebrated and welcomed 2012, it's time to start living it! Whatever happened in 2011 is now in the distant past -- so distant that this year's calendar doesn't even recognize its existence! Whatever burdens one has from last year can now be forgotten and replaced with the freshness and innocence of the new year.

2012 is a leap year, so if we prove the sceptics wrong and live past the December 21 Apocalypse, we'll have an <i>extra</i> day this year to go on a trip, make someone's day, create something helpful, learn something new, and take in all there is to experience.

As I'm writing all of these things, I'm mulling over how curious it is that nearly everyone on the planet is so sentimental about the division of time into years. As I said &quot;forget last year,&quot; I thought to myself, &quot;what's so different between December 31, 2011 and January 1, 2012?&quot; And the more I mull it over, the more I realize that there <i>is</i> a difference. Our attitudes, thoughts, and actions are all controlled by our mentality; and this <i>mental</i> division that we created to represent our orbit around the sun actually <i>does</i> have a real effect on our existence.

The &quot;freshness&quot; of the new year is nothing physical or concrete, but is instead conveyed through the mental sense of renewal and innocence that comes with the concept of a &quot;New Year&quot;. This year, push myself to live each day to its fullest, focus on the big picture, and try to be as big a part of that picture as possible. I'm convinced that we'd all benefit from doing so!

HAPPY New Year :)"

Venice (Italian: Venezia [veˈnɛttsja] , Venetian: Venexia [veˈnɛsja]) is a city in northern Italy known both for tourism and for industry, and is the capital of the region Veneto, with a population of the whole Comune of about 270,660 (census estimate 30 April 2009). Together with Padua and Treviso, the city is included in the Padua-Treviso-Venice Metropolitan Area (PATREVE) (population 1,600,000).
The name is derived from the ancient people of Veneti that inhabited the region as of 10th century B.C. The city historically was the capital of the Venetian Republic. Venice has been known as the &quot;La Dominante&quot;, &quot;Serenissima&quot;, &quot;Queen of the Adriatic&quot;, &quot;City of Water&quot;, &quot;City of Masks&quot;, &quot;City of Bridges&quot;, &quot;The Floating City&quot;, and &quot;City of Canals&quot;. Luigi Barzini, writing in The New York Times, described it as &quot;undoubtedly the most beautiful city built by man&quot;. Venice has also been described by the Times Online as being one of Europe's most romantic cities.
The city stretches across 117 small islands in the marshy Venetian Lagoon along the Adriatic Sea in northeast Italy. The saltwater lagoon stretches along the shoreline between the mouths of the Po (south) and the Piave (north) Rivers. The population estimate of 272,000 inhabitants includes the population of the whole Comune of Venezia; around 60,000[5] in the historic city of Venice (Centro storico); 176,000 in Terraferma (the Mainland), mostly in the large frazioni of Mestre and Marghera; and 31,000 live on other islands in the lagoon.
The Republic of Venice was a major maritime power during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, and a staging area for the Crusades and the Battle of Lepanto, as well as a very important center of commerce (especially silk, grain and spice trade) and art in the 13th century up to the end of the 17th century. This made Venice a wealthy city throughout most of its history. It is also known for its several important artistic movements, especially the Renaissance period. Venice has played an important role in the history of symphonic and operatic music, and it is the birthplace of Antonio Vivaldi.

So even if you don't have time to say much, just say &quot;I was here&quot; and I'll know you cared enough to say &quot;Hi&quot;. I am as guilty of leaving quick comments anymore during the week, because everyone of you are posting such wonderful images I want to say &quot;Hi&quot; to all. So I'm sorry if you just get a &quot;Nice Shot&quot; from me. I will try to think of something else to say in the future.

We were wandering through the apes exhibit at the Jacksonville, Florida zoo when we came upon this tender family moment. I shot maybe two dozen frames, but since they were all extremely similar, I decided to keep just one. The difficult part was laboring through them and deciding which I liked the best. I kept this one, I hope it meets with your approval.

Se trata de un conjunto de chimeneas volcánicas en forma de afloramientos rocosos al pie del faro de Cabo de Gata, en el extremo meridional del parque natural.

Según la tradición, debe su nombre a los antiguos marineros que confundían los gritos de la foca monje del Mediterráneo (Monachus monachus), antigua habitante de estas rocas, con el canto de las ninfas marinas.

Bajando desde el faro pueden contemplarse los restos de un antiguo embarcadero y una pequeña cala de arena blanca que permanece sumergida durante las mareas altas."

<strong><u>About</u></strong>

On the right side there is the old Lamot Brewery ( no longer in production ), there's a wooden pathway that floats on the water, on the other side is the 'Vismarkt' which  means fish market.

<strong><u>The shot</u></strong>

I put my tripod as close as possible to the railing, to have that line of glimmering metal in this standard 3 exposure HDR shot.

<strong><u>Photoshop</u></strong>

Just a tiny 'Curves' and a bit of extra saturation, a little unsharp mask, I cropped the image a little on the left to get rid of a fragment of the chimney.

<strong><u>You</u></strong>

Today we welcomed home the newest member of our family, Banjo. After spending a few weeks or so appeasing ourselves with this stuffed pug, the breeder was confident this weekend that Banjo was ready to depart from his home and litter of six to join our home.

He's an early birthday present for my soon-to-be-ten-year-old brother, and he couldn't be happier! Banjo is a Chinese Pug -- his father is actually an immigrant from China, and we have the immigration papers to prove it! Dogs have their own houses, clothing, strollers, medical records, and now immigration papers. What next? :P

The car ride home was a little rough, but once he met his little inanimate friend here (a rigorous sniffing routine was first on Banjo's agenda when he arrived in our living room) and got used to our huge faces, he calmed down and has since been happily batting toys around and napping.

I'm looking forward to the adventures our new little companion will have. I haven't had a dog or cat since I was eight, so this will be quite exciting! (Not to mention a new built-in model for photos! I've been leaving my camera around for him to sniff and get used to. He's going to need to do that fairly quickly if he's to be in my presence :P)"

I think here the Ball of Light was just soaking it all in, or was he waiting for the doors to open? Not sure. But I do know that the Golden Ball of Light was out plenty, as it was a pretty golden place!

I am often asked (and recently challenged) about the time these images are taken. This was at about 20 minutes past midnight. The palace had absolutely no lighting on it at all. There was a fullish moon, and an even covering of light cloud which gave a very even light. About an hour later the cloud got thicker, and I had to pull out my own lighting. 

And fun to boot!

&quot;Siglufjörður is a small fishing town in a narrow fjord with the same name on the northern coast of Iceland.
 
Population in January 2011 was 1,206 but the town has been shrinking in size since the 1950s when the town reached its peak with 3,000 inhabitants.

The town grew up around the herring industry that was in much bloom in the 1940s and 1950s, but the herring are gone now. Silglufjörður is often nicknamed Herring Town. 
 
Siglufjörður was connected with a road for the first time in 1940, when the horse riding trail through Siglufjarðarskarð was improved enabling cars to get through. Before, ships, seaplanes, horses and strong legs provided the transport.&quot;

There were a total of 2 attendees including  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/ivanomak/"">Ivan Makarov</a> and me.  Jim Patterson almost made it, but we will not make him feel bad about that awesome light filtering through the thick cloud deck, or the huge surf that was pounding the beach on this first day of winter.  Nor will we mention how there was absolutely no wind to spray salt onto the filters.  True, it was a warm evening where we could be in the water all afternoon without feeling the least bit cold, but we'll leave that detail out so as not to make Jim upset about missing the summit! And I have about 10 shots that have light like this from just this afternoon of shooting.  But I'd never brag or boast about how we happened to be in just the perfect spot at the perfect time and how the light seemed to go on forever and ever.  

I mean, why make Jim suffer?

i pluged my 77mm CL polarizing filter on my lens.
as well as a graduated ND8 filter to partly cover the bright sky and clouds.
and ofcourse a release cable to minimize camera shake. + bubble level to alighn the camera correctly to the horizon. (i found out that bubble level is a must have for all photographers unless your DSLR has this functionality built-in like canon 60D).

I decided I wanted to do a Jump shot and recruited the Lovely Sam to help me after Pilates.  I had in my head doing the shot outside the Civic Hall where I teach my Pilates class.  I had it all planned: me, Hollywood, tripod, remote release and the impressive victorian building lit up by floodlight.  Of course it rained so my plans were ruined and we skulked off for our usual post-pilates hot chocolate at Wetherspoons pub.

Then Sam suggested we do it in there and well, the ladies toilet has the most excellent jumpology spot!

Although not apparent we are both wearing our Pilates uniforms - Hollywood has workout pants and a Tameside Pilates teeshirt made for me by Sam."

<i>&quot;The fact that I can plant a seed and it becomes a flower, share a bit of knowledge and it becomes another's, smile at someone and receive a smile in return, are to me continual spiritual exercises.&quot;  
</i>~Leo Buscaglia

We can express our spirituality in many different ways and in many differeny places and times. We don't have to wait until we are at a place of formal worship to exercise our spirituality.  Every moment that we are alive and aware is an opportunity to acknowledge and express our connection to other people and to the world.

Be open to the experiences with other people and with nature today. Recognize the miracle of Life and your place in it....

Vista de l'Albufera de València a poqueta nit. L'espill de llum solar que es forma sobre les aigües és conegut localment com El Lluent (lluent).
L'Albufera de València és una llacuna costanera succinta (profunditat mitjana d'1 m) situada en la costa mediterrània al sud de la ciutat de València. Té una extensió de 23,94 ICM, i està rodejada de 223 ICM d'arrossars.[2] La seua conca hidrogràfica té una extensió de 917,1 ICM, que s'estén des del nivell del mar fins una altitud d'uns 1.000 msnm. Està separada del mar per una estreta barra litoral (restinga) arenosa amb dunes estabilitzades per un bosc de pins (Devesa del Saler). L'Albufera és una zona de pas per a moltes espècies d'aus migratòries.
El seu valor ecològic és molt gran ja que ací es troben espècies de gran valor ecològic en perill d'extinció, com el Fartet o el Samaruc. A més és una de les poques Albuferes que es conserven en bon estat a la Comunitat Valenciana, la costa de la qual antigament estava formada per una successió d'albuferes i marjals. Hui en dia encara es poden veure la successió de marjals en tota la costa valenciana, encara que més xicotet que l'Albufera de València, des de la marjal de Pego-Oliva, la marjal de Xeraco, la marjal de Rafalell i Vistabella a Massamagrell, la marjal del moro a Puçol-Sagunt, o la marjal d'Almenara, entre altres.

La Albufera de Valencia es una laguna costera somera (profundidad media de 1 m) situada en la costa mediterránea al sur de la ciudad de Valencia. Tiene una extensión de 23,94 Km², y está rodeada de 223 Km² de arrozales.[2] Su cuenca hidrográfica tiene una extensión de 917,1 Km², que se extiende desde el nivel del mar hasta una altitud de unos 1.000 msnm. Está separada del mar por una estrecha barra litoral (restinga) arenosa con dunas estabilizadas por un bosque de pinos (Dehesa del Saler). La Albufera es una zona de paso para muchas especies de aves migratorias.
Su valor ecológico es muy grande ya que aquí se encuentran especies de gran valor ecológico en peligro de extinción, como el Fartet o el Samaruc. Además es una de las pocas Albuferas que se conservan en buen estado en la Comunidad Valenciana, cuya costa antiguamente estaba formada por una sucesión de albuferas y marjales. Hoy en día aún se pueden ver la sucesión de marjales en toda la costa valenciana, aunque de menor tamaño que la Albufera de Valencia, desde el marjal de Pego-Oliva, el marjal de Jaraco, el marjal de Rafalell y Vistabella en Masamagrell, el marjal del moro en Puzol-Sagunto, o el marjal de Almenara, entre otros."
7309680988,"The church takes its name from the Latin word &quot;Gallicantu&quot;, meaning cock-crow. This is in commemoration of Peter's triple rejection of Jesus &quot;... before the cock crows thrice.&quot; (Mark 14:30)

A Byzantine shrine dedicated to Peter's repentance was erected on this spot in 457 AD, but was destroyed by the Fatimid caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah in 1010. The chapel was rebuilt by Crusaders in 1102 and given its present name. After the fall of Jerusalem the church again fell into ruin and was not rebuilt until 1931. Today a golden rooster protrudes prominently from the sanctuary roof in honor of its biblical connection. This spot is also believed to be the location of the High Priest Caiaphas' palace. According to the Pilgrim of Bordeaux in his Itinerarium Burdigalense, &quot;...going up from the Pool of Siloe to Mount Zion one would come across the House of the Priest Caiaphas.&quot;

He jokingly asked me, if we’d take the photo with the police car in the background, but I felt better leaving it out.

The clouds were heavy before sunrise but they cleared out just enough to allow the sun to light up the 4,000 ft. mountain range behind the beach. Without that light, the scene did not have the punch and depth that is does in this photo. Summer is when the light strikes across the mountains at the best angle.

Story:
---------------------------------------------------------

Well, okay....

I decided to take in the sights at the ruins of the old Sutro Baths, built in 1896 to be an indoor/outdoor salt-water pool and spa.  It was 250x500 ft (80m x 160m) and could hold 3700 spectators and over 1000 swimmers.  See the link below for video footage from 1897!  Yes, we were high-tech even back then.  I do think that Edison's copyright for the videos has expired by now though....

Anyway, I was thinking about some long exposures after I had photographed some big surf so I walked along the haunted concrete walkways crossing over what seem like ancient ruins.  I did a couple of long exposures and as I set up for one last shot, a couple decided to plop right down in front.  Rather than worry about it, I worked them into the photo by moving to the right far enough to get them separated from the dark background of the offshore rocks.  That way they stood out well against the background.  They stayed put for the entire time and 4 minutes later, I was finished!

One big advantage in this place is that you do not have to have model releases for ghosts!

Waterfalls, forests, wildflowers, eagles, bears, even bighorn sheep.  The mountains here are actually physically taller and more dramatic than those outside of both Denver and Salt Lake.  It's just that they start at sea level and only get snow in the winter months.  I took this shot on the Mt Wilson trail, which climbs a mile in elevation in just a couple of hours of hiking, and which is the way most of the elements to construct the first big telescope up top were hauled up back in the first years of the twentieth century.  The trailhead is at the end of a suburban street, a two minute drive from the city limits of Pasadena.

Watching a bunch of kids carefully ascending this ice hill and then racing back down with not so much as one sled, &quot;crazy carpet,&quot; or other snow vehicle in sight reminds me of just how imaginative, resourceful, and carefree kids can be when they're in the mood to have fun, or have the need to be resourceful for any number of other reasons.

It must be a natural instinct to use everything available to us, because I never *had* to be resourceful as a child. I had food, water, shelter, toys, electricity, and all of the modern conveniences one could ask for. Yet I was still able to entertain myself for hours climbing trees, making can-and-wire walkie talkies, or pretending to be an architect with nothing but sticks and dirt. I remember that all of my friends were this way, too.

Although this ability is becoming incredibly rare in today's society, some kids still have it, and it's unbelievably refreshing to see in action :)

The angle of the afternoon sun was getting to be just right for the best view of the 2425 foot high Yosemite Falls from the swinging bridge. But it was mostly cloudy. So I waited about 20 minutes for an opening in the clouds to light up the falls. A group of photographers and other people had showed up to see the view. They moved bridge around a lot (it is the swinging bridge after all!) and I wanted a 30-second exposure with my dark filter. I really feel like a long exposure in this situation captures the mood and feel of the place better than a short exposure.  I did do a few short exposures but there was something missing when I looked at them.  So I deleted them.  I do a lot of rather severe editing on the spot because I can compare them with how I feel at the moment.

I wanted a stable platform, so I climbed over the edge of the railing and down into a small space under the bridge on a concrete piling to make this image!  I had about 2 feet of clearance for me and the tripod so I had to compose this without the viewfinder.  It is a pain when you wait without moving for 30 seconds and then find out that the horizon is not flat because you can not look through the viewfinder.  So it took 3 tries before I got it right.  Then the light went away.  I waited another 20 minutes in this rather uncomfortable position hoping for another chance, but that was it for the light for the day.

People were leaning over the bridge looking at me asking if I was okay.  And they really gave me looks when I came back up.  Also, it was hard to walk after being confined on a small spot of hard concrete for about 40 minutes!  Was it worth it?

The map shows exactly where this is.  It is an easy 0.3-mile hike from the nearest road.

I didn't notice him until my second trip into the house. I went back out to my car, fetched some batteries, went back into the house for the camera, switched out my batteries, and went out to the globe outside my garage. The whole time, he (?) never moved.

After shooting him on my shoulder (a contortionistic feat!) I moved him to my hand, and suddenly he got quite active. He was hard to shoot, he kept moving around, lifting himself up, antennae quivering. I finally got two decent shots out of the whole affair, and ffnally shook him off to let him explore a nearby tree. He's a leaf-eater, so, he was probably quite content.

I have said it before, but it doesn't hurt to say it again:
please, no multiple invitations to groups and no invitations without comments, please.
And also, avoid one word comments at all costs, PLEASE. Not only on my photos, everywhere.
It's really not nice to comment &quot;nice&quot; on people's photos. Every photographer knows their photos are &quot;nice&quot;, if they didn't think their photos were &quot;nice&quot; enough, they wouldn't share them.
Please, take your time to develop a decent comment. 

Someone said that the photographer shouldn't be so fazed by one word comments and rather focus on the good intentions of such comment. 
I don't see it that way. If you can't spare a few more seconds to write a better comment, it can only mean that you are fishing for comments and will make the most comments you can in order to get more people to look at your photos. 

Another excuse that is given is that &quot;my english is very poor&quot;. I can perfectly understand any comment made in english, portuguese, french, italian and spanish, so there's no excuse. Also, if you are a speaker of any other language, you can very well use online translators to write simpler comments, but still longer than just &quot;beautiful&quot;. You have learned what &quot;beautiful&quot; means, right? Make an extra unworldly effort and learn how to translate: &quot;beautiful composition, amazing light too&quot; or something like that.
If you absolutely have no time to write longer comments, than just fave the photo. If you don't think  my photos are worthy of your very precioius fave, then just don't comment at all. I'd rather have only 50 thoughtfull comments on my photos than 100 comment and half of them being as meaningless as &quot;beautiful&quot;. &quot;Beautiful&quot; what? Please, tell me what you think is beautiful on my photos. The model's eyes? The colors? 
Look at the photo and show me you actually looked at it. Serial commenters can comment &quot;beautiful&quot; on nearly anything and I know for a fact that there are people that don't even wait for the photo to open before they comment.

And I wonder why did I even write this... serial commenters will NEVER stop to read this."

After a rainy afternoon in Paris. The clouds finally broke away and left us with these beautiful puddles reflecting the Eiffel Towers iconic glow. 

The Eiffel Tower (French: La Tour Eiffel, [tuʁ ɛfɛl], nickname La dame de fer, the iron lady) is a wrought iron lattice tower located on the Champ de Mars in Paris. Built in 1889, it has become both a global icon of France and one of the most recognizable structures in the world. The tower is the tallest building in Paris[10] and the most-visited paid monument in the world; millions of people ascend it every year. Named after its designer, engineer Gustave Eiffel, the tower was built as the entrance arch to the 1889 World's Fair.
The tower stands 324 metres (1,063 ft) tall, about the same height as an 81-storey building. During its construction, the Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to assume the title of the tallest man-made structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years, until the Chrysler Building in New York City was built in 1930. However, due to the addition, in 1957, of the antenna atop the Eiffel Tower, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building. Not including broadcast antennas, it is the second-tallest structure in France, after the Millau Viaduct.
The tower has three levels for visitors. Tickets can be purchased to ascend, by stairs or lift, to the first and second levels. The walk from ground level to the first level is over 300 steps, as is the walk from the first to the second level. The third and highest level is accessible only by elevator. Both the first and second levels feature restaurants.
The tower has become the most prominent symbol of both Paris and France, often in the establishing shot of films set in the city."

A photo shoot of Ferrero Rocher's chocolate on my table.

Facts: Ferrero Rocher is a spherical chocolate sweet made by Italian chocolatier Ferrero SpA, the producer of Tic Tac and Nutella. Introduced to the world in 1982, the chocolates consist of a whole roasted hazelnut encased in a thin wafer shell filled with hazelnut cream and covered in milk chocolate and chopped hazelnuts and walnuts. Rocher comes from French and means &quot;rock&quot;.

5692683652,"Best viewed on black, I think. 

First off, let me apologize to all of you who have visited my photo stream and/or, made nice comments etc. I have been out of commission a bit with a bout of repetitive stress injury in my right arm. I've had it on and off for years and it's a result of too much time at the keyboard and mouse. So, I thought I'd better back off a bit. Anyway... I'll try to get up to speed as soon as I can. 

This shot was taken tonight (It's straight out of the camera), about an hour or so ago. The POV is Twin Peaks, one of the most visited tourist spots in San Francisco. I live about 5 blocks from there. So, I went up there tonight with camera, 12-24 lens, tripod and not one, not two but three Neutral Density Filters: I had a 3, a 6 and a 9, all stacked on my lens. 

Now, what I hadn't counted on was forgetting my light source to check settings etc, nor had I counted on the fact that the wind would be howling and the temperature would be frigid. As I said, I live only about 5 blocks away and was sitting on my deck comfortably in short sleeves. 

Anyway, I was up there about an hour and a half. By the time I thought I should start un-stacking the filters, I was so cold that my hands were numb. I was afraid I'd drop them in the dark and break them etc. So, I settled for about 30 shots. None of them are good but this seems to be about the best of a bad lot. 

I shot it on Nikon D90, Tokina 12-24 ATX Pro lens, Gitzo tripod and RRS BH 40 head. I used remote wire release. The settings were ISO 200, 1ev, F4 for 10 seconds. I was at 14mm (21 in Nikon digital translation), shutter priority and manual focus (duh). Anyway, that's my story and if anyone has a way to make it better, I'm open to suggestions. :-)

BTW, the brightly lit street running away from the camera is Market Street. At the far end of Market, just to the right, is the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge. The dark area in the foreground is the grassy slope of the hill. I tried to get some shots of the Golden Gate Bridge but need a longer lens (and, fewer ND filters and warmer hands with a flashlight).

Papaver rhoeas, la amapola silvestre, es una especie fanerógama del género Papaver, perteneciente a la familia Papaveraceae.

<b>Descripción</b>

Es una planta de ciclo anual que puede alcanzar más de 50 cm de altura. Posee tallos erectos y poco ramificados con finos pelillos.
Las hojas, que nacen alternas a lo largo del tallo, sin peciolo, son pinnadas y muy dentadas en los márgenes con una única nervadura central.
Las flores de color escarlata intenso, acampanadas y casi esféricas, poseen 4 finos pétalos y 2 sépalos vellosos. Los pétalos son muy delicados y se marchitan rápidamente, por lo que las flores no pueden usarse en adornos florales. Los estambres, de color negro, forman un racimo anillado alrededor del gineceo, lo que le da el aspecto de botón negro. El fruto es una cápsula verde pálido de forma cónica con una especie de tapa en la parte superior (opérculo), conteniendo numerosas semillas que escapan a través de las grietas del opérculo. Florecen de principio a final de la primavera.
La amapola se ha asociado a la agricultura desde épocas antiguas. Su ciclo de vida se adapta a la mayoría de los cultivos de cereales, floreciendo y granando antes de la recolección de las cosechas. Aunque se la considera una mala hierba es fácil de combatir con los habituales métodos de control de plagas.

<b>Usos</b>

Las hojas son levemente venenosas para los animales herbívoros. Las hojas verdes frescas (antes de la floración) pueden cocinarse como las espinacas y son muy apetecibles, con un sabor característico, perdiendo las propiedades venenosas al cocinarse, aunque con efectos sedantes por los alcaloides que contiene, por lo que su consumo como alimento ha venido decayendo en el sur de Europa. Las semillas son inofensivas y a menudo se utilizan como condimento y en bollería mientras que los pétalos se usan para elaborar siropes y bebidas no alcohólicas. La savia, pétalos y cápsulas contienen rhoeadina, un alcaloide de efectos ligeramente sedantes, a diferencia de la variedad Papaver somniferum (adormidera u opio) que contiene morfina. El consumo excesivo puede causar molestias intestinales, y hasta dolor de estómago.

<b>Distribución geográfica</b>

No se sabe el origen de Papaver rhoeas, pero se encuentra ampliamente extendida en Eurasia y el norte de África (donde se emplea para la elaboración de cosméticos). Por encontrarse frecuentemente en áreas de cultivo, la Papaver rhoeas se ha extendido con las zonas de agricultura, es decir que han colonizado áreas debido a la influencia del hombre (plantas hemerochories).

My flickr pal, Lisa had an <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/santacrewsgirl/4315763031"">interesting experience</a> in Chinatown this past weekend, and I <em>think</em> this may be the same string of lanterns that appeared in her photo. (or close by)

The lanterns made me think about  each of us and our similarities, but also our individualitiy and how we're connected to one another through our love of photography, and in this case, San Francisco.

Thankfully, and with great respect and admiration, I have several wonderful and talented friends/contacts in San Francisco and the Bay Area that are constant reminders of this fascination. 

I shot this while on a photo-walk with Zen Zoe who was the very first of those friends.  It was a fabulous day that I will always remember.

Day 63 of 365

I almost totally gave up today. No ideas... actually most my pictures I just sit there.. wondering what else I could take a picture of... like yesterdays VOSS water bottle. I was literally sitting there, no clue.. I walked back upstairs, saw the bottle sitting there, so I just grabbed it and took the pic. Yesterdays picture took like 2 minutes to take. This picture (after I came up with the idea) took about 1-2 minutes to take. Its just coming up with this idea... every... single... day.... that takes forever.

The photo is taken on blue paper. I just ripped through the blue paper then chrome keyed it out. I was originally going to have me popping out of a photo of a beach or something... but I didn't like the way it looked. So I just did it against orange... and I even finished editing it, uploaded it to Flickr.. and when I saw it on flickr, I thought.. &quot;Hmm.. that would have been cool if it was against white cause it would have looked like I was coming out of the webpage&quot;... then it hit me.. coming out of the flickr homepage! So I quickly deleted the photo I just uploaded and started editing all over. Took a screen shot of Flickr against white (meaning, I had to change my wallpaper on my computer to white cause Windows 7 has transparent windows and a screen capture would have shown the background around the edges). Most the editing in this photo was the warping of the webpage around the tears to make it look more real. Like the search box and stuff.  Also, this is the first picture I ever uploaded that isn't 25 mega pixel! lol (since I resized the pic to match the website, hehe)

Today was my first day using my new USB Follow Focus... WOW! What an amazing device. If you haven't seen this thing, check it out here: <a href=""http://www.okii.net"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">www.okii.net</a>  This new follow focus is so amazing. It literally lets you control almost every setting on the camera all from the device and a USB cable. I usually always have my camera hooked up to an HDMI monitor, but I always had to walk back to the camera to adjust settings or focus, etc.. Now with this USB Follow Focus, I have a 20 foot USB cable and I can look at the HDMI monitor and control every. I can enable video mode, focus, change aperture, shutter, ISO, zoom into x10 for the fine tuning of focusing and I can move around the focus points, etc.. It's worth every penny. (If you hook a laptop up to your camera and use the EOS utility to control your camera, you get all the same settings, so this is just eliminating the computer)

I spent a couple days in Barcelona this week. A fantastic city.

I was walking around the St Josep market off las Ramblas (a must see if you ever go there!), when I saw this very pretty girl with beautiful pink hair. I have been wanting to start a stranger project for a while, but must admit that I am a bit shy to approach people and ask... I thought I should ask this girl because she has a very beautiful and unique style. But again, I hesitated to long and lost them in the crowd. I continue walking through the market and promise myself that if I bumped into to her again, this time I'll go for it and ask. Unfortunately, I did not see her.

Half an hour later, I am having a coffee near by, on Place de Real, when I look up and see the two girls setting at the same cafe having a drink.  I dont know if they were there before me or arrive after. But I did not have a choice, I needed to get over my shyness and ask.

Luckily, they both kindly accepted. They were from England which made it even easier for the language.

So here it is. My stranger number 1, the pretty girl with pink hair.

It is the tallest Ferris wheel in Europe, and the most popular paid tourist attraction in the United Kingdom, visited by over 3.5 million people annually. When erected in 1999, it was the tallest Ferris wheel in the world, until surpassed first by the 160 m (520 ft) Star of Nanchang in 2006, and then the 165 m (541 ft) Singapore Flyer in 2008. It is still described by its operators as &quot;the world's tallest cantilevered observation wheel&quot; (as the wheel is supported by an A-frame on one side only, unlike the Nanchang and Singapore wheels).

The London Eye, or Millennium Wheel, was officially called the British Airways London Eye and then the Merlin Entertainments London Eye. Since 20 January 2011, its official name is the EDF Energy London Eye following a three-year sponsorship deal.

The London Eye is located in the London Borough of Lambeth at the western end of Jubilee Gardens, on the South Bank of the River Thames between Westminster Bridge and Hungerford Bridge. The site is adjacent to that of the former Dome of Discovery, which was built for the Festival of Britain in 1951."

La torre, unica superstite quasi inalterata nella casa dei Vialardi, venne edificata agli inizi del XV secolo e si erge elegante, snella e diritta con un fusto ottagonale, in cui si aprono due finestre al di sopra di altri edifici addossati alla sua base. La parte superiore è formata da un primo livello di piombatoie poco sporgenti sormontato da un secondo livello dotato di otto finestre bifore orlate di fregi in terracotta, qualcuna cieca e murata dal lato nord ed in cima una copertura a travata a tese larghe. Si hanno notizie del rifacimento del tetto nel XIX secolo (R.ORDANO, Torri e castelli del Vercellese). Essa è, tra le torri vercellesi, probabilmente quella che ha meglio conservato il suo aspetto originario. Entrando nel piccolo cortile, con ingresso in Via Cagna, sono visibili, affioranti dalle pareti perimetrali, le arcate di quello che,in antico era un portico rinascimentale e, più in alto, si scorge la traccia di un fregio ad affresco (assegnabile alla fine del '400- R.ORDANO, Torri e castelli del Vercellese) che decorava l'ambiente, con forse altre decorazioni. Questo è il luogo in cui i Vialardi risiedettero fin dagli inizi del 1200, quando vi trasferirono dalle loro proprietà site in Via Duomo, di fronte a Palazzo Pasta, poiché in esse, mediante acquisto, vi si installò il Comune.

I always liked photographs of old cars, parked in an usual street.
When I passed this scene I instantly recognized the potential of it, since it was parked in a street that looked particularly old, or rather timeless.

The composition might not be too special, but I was proud of capturing the mood I wanted to convey.
Creating images yourself, that are similar to images that you loved even before you started with photography is something very valueble for me.

<b>Emerald Bay, Lake tahoe III </b>


This picture was taken during my recent ski trip to beautiful Lake Tahoe. 
Location : <b>Lake tahoe , California.</b>

Emerald Bay is located on the southwest shore of Lake Tahoe in Eldorado County. The 593 acre Emerald Bay State Park surrounds this turquoise blue bay which has been designated as a National Natural Landmark by the U.S. Department of Interior. The bay itself has been deemed one of the 'most photographed places on earth'.

At the end of our Ski trip we decided to visit Emerald Bay before heading for home. It was a cold day and we almost reached the bay, till we came to a dead stop, all cars had stopped. We found that just before the bay an avalanche occured, thus no way to drive. Instead of sitting in the car, we decided to go for a hike and find a spot for a few shots, well !! we found this spot overlooking the beautiful bay.....woooo !! the snow was deep upto my knees and my friend Jignesh and me carefully climed in this area and got this shot.


Lake Tahoe is a large freshwater lake in the Sierra Nevada mountains of the United States. It is located along the border between California and Nevada, west of Carson City, Nevada. Lake Tahoe is the largest alpine lake in North America

6338172525,"Our Daily Challenge - &quot;Arches&quot;

Arches are a universal symbol of power, of class, and of wealth. I think they earned this high acclaim because of the architectural difficulty in assembling an arched structure; thousands of years ago, cranes, computer simulations, and advanced physics didn't exist to aid them in constructing their beautiful creations.

Today, however, arches are commonplace. Although they still represent nature's complex existence (they have infinite sides, and are devoid of a beginning or ending -- pretty mystical), we have mastered the ability to build and create with them. This portion of West Edmonton Mall, constructed in the early '80s is a perfect example. Except even though this place is beautiful, it's not shockingly beautiful as it once was.

Just goes to show how our senses dampen over time, so much so that we sometimes completely ignore all of these magical stimuli around us."

I have been sifting through some old photos, and again one has jumped out that was looked over. I suppose I am getting picky these days, and this Ball of Light was a bit wobbly here. Could be the drop off that would certainly have lead to its certain death.

This is up at the Flinders Ranges in South Australia. An ancient mountain range. 

The Ball of Light has a bit of a love affair with the Flinders, but this night it was certainly feeling like the golden child. Might have been the incredibly rich colours of the rocks and dust around up there.

I cant wait to get back up there and look for more!

Golden Gate Park windmill facts 
The history of Golden Gate Park's north and south windmills: 

1870: The &quot;Act to Provide for the Improvement of Public Parks in the City of San Francisco'' creates Golden Gate Park. 

1901: The Recreation and Park Commission authorizes the construction of a windmill 300 yards from the ocean. This windmill could take advantage of the prevailing winds to pump water for park irrigation. 

1902: The Dutch (north) windmill is completed at a cost of $25,000. 

1905: Samuel Murphy, vice president of Hibernia Bank, finances the south (Murphy) windmill. It becomes the largest of its kind in the world. 

1913: Motorized pumps are installed to augment the wind-driven system. With the windmills no longer performing a primary function, their maintenance is neglected and they eventually cease to operate. 

1964: Eleanor Rossi Crabtree, daughter of late Mayor Angelo Rossi, initiates a campaign to save the north, or Dutch, windmill. 

1980: As a result of the campaign, the north windmill gets cosmetic repairs. 

1993: The San Francisco Recreation and Park Department, with San Francisco Beautiful, arranges for an extensive study of the south (Murphy) windmill. Lucas Verbij, a Dutch windmill design and construction expert, concludes that the windmill is in need of immediate attention. 

2000: The city commits $500,000 toward Murphy Windmill restoration.

This is Yitty a paceful village in the capital Muscat. in this shot i used my Tamron 10-24mm @ 13mm with ISO speed of 100 and exposure time set to 3.2 seconds. this exposure time was enough to partly blur the waves since the waves there were quite harsh.

i pluged my 77mm CL polarizing filter on my lens.
as well as a graduated ND8 filter to partly cover the bright sky and clouds.
and ofcourse a release cable to minimize camera shake. + bubble level to alighn the camera correctly to the horizon. (i found out that bubble level is a must have for all photographers unless your DSLR has this functionality built-in like canon 60D).

if you look at the right side of the image, you will notice a sand storm coming up towards me!! that what blow me away afterwards.

i spent nice time over there and shot many photos.. and ofcourse i went back home with dripping clothes!! LoL :D"

On July 4th, this was the natural fireworks show we got above our home.  

Notes: A rare textbook double rainbow here, one of the best I've seen in some time.  See how the fainter secondary rainbow colors are reversed from the primary bow?  Also note Alexander's dark band in between the two bows, see how it is darker than in or out?  And then perhaps most fascinating to most people is note how underneath the primary bow is extra bright?  That's because rainbows are not a discrete series of colored rings, we're talking spherical raindrops projecting out giant discs of light.

2123962007,"&quot;The Elfin Hill&quot; is the title of a story written by Hans Christian Andersen however, IMHO, that title could have also been a wonderful name for the forest of Sintra. Actually, just as a matter of curiosity, i should tell you that Andersen made a trip to Portugal, in 1866, to visit a friend who was, at the time, spending the weekend in its farm &quot;Quinta do Pinheiro&quot; located in the Sintra forest area. Yup, Anderson was a guest there for a while. Could he have been inspired by the magic of the place? Well, that i don't really know but what i do know is that the story of  &quot;The Elfin Hill&quot; is wonderful and full of magic, much like the Sintra forest.

We met in Curitiba when I went there some days ago and we had a fantastic evening. We had lunch at a fancy japanese restaurant (where I cried, because I put too much wasabi on my shoyu hehehe love it! :D )
we talked (aka gossiped - tricotaaaaando, parecíamos duas comadres fofoqueiras hahaha) a lot, then we went to a super cool Ice-Cream shop (where he showed his lack of skills for handling spoons with ice cream, as you can see in the photo haha :D). After that he took me to the botanic gardens as well, but we couldn't stay more than... 10 minutes lol... we were running out of time :P
that was REALLY great to meet him, that's one of the friends I adore from flickr.

just one thing he said that kind of ticked me off: &quot;Wow! you really look like the person in your photos&quot;
what the...? lol... yeah, well, when you take self portraits, that's really interesting how you are supposed to look like... yourself ;P
then he explained that *some people* photoshop so much the self portraits that well, pretty much look like a different person in each photo.
to what I said: well, YOU don't look nothing like your photos! :P You're blond! there's not one single photo in your stream where you're blond!! I must be the treatment you give to your photos :P hehehehe


now... as I usually say, the people that like me the most, have the &quot;liberty&quot; of speaking somethings to me... they are the ones that are always teasing and making fun of something... Now he's met me, everytime he can, he's saying something funny... 
nhé! ;P


He also gave me a dvd with lots of horror movies... hahahaha some wicked stuff :P
Thanks Ale!! you are great!!! ;***

<b>Monument Valley</b> (Navajo: Tsé Biiʼ Ndzisgaii, meaning valley of the rocks) is a region of the Colorado Plateau characterized by a cluster of vast sandstone buttes, the largest reaching 1,000 ft (300 m) above the valley floor. It is located on the southern border of Utah with northern Arizona (around 36°59′N 110°6′W﻿ / ﻿36.983°N 110.1°W﻿ / 36.983; -110.1), near the Four Corners area. The valley lies within the range of the Navajo Nation Reservation, and is accessible from U.S. Highway 163.

The area is part of the Colorado Plateau. The floor is largely Cutler Red siltstone or its sand deposited by the meandering rivers that carved the valley. The valley's vivid red color comes from iron oxide exposed in the weathered siltstone. The darker, blue-gray rocks in the valley get their color from manganese oxide.

The buttes are clearly stratified, with three principal layers. The lowest layer is Organ Rock shale, the middle de Chelly sandstone and the top layer is Moenkopi shale capped by Shinarump siltstone. The valley includes large stone structures including the famed Eye of the Sun.

Between 1948 and 1967, the southern extent of the Monument Upwarp was mined for uranium, which occurs in scattered areas of the Shinarump siltstone; vanadium and copper are associated with uranium in some deposits (see Uranium mining in Arizona).

When we, as artists, view a landscape, our minds also act as mirrors, reflecting what we see much like the lake or pond.

<b>This big bull was amazing.  We found the harem early in the am and then we heard him bugle and knew he was close.  I was photographing the females when he came thundering up the hill from the creek to be sure they were all safe and no threat was coming from us.  (my husband and I) He came toward me and gave me the 'I'm the boss stance' and sniffed a bit and then decided I was no problem and went back to circling the ladies.  The 'decorations' on his antlers are weeds from the stream.  You can see his beautiful rut beard is all wet.

His antlers still look a bit raw from rubbing off all the velvet.

This panorama was constructed using Photoshop Elements to stitch together vertically two landscape-oriented images captured from within the Upper Antelope Canyon.
Antelope Canyon is privately owned and may be visited only as part of a guided tour conducted by one of the companies licensed to do so. Two types of tours are generally offered: Regular and Photographic. Regular tours last about an hour, are offered throughout the daylight hours, and consist of a trip into the canyon and back out. Photographic tours last about two hours, are offered only during the midday hours (while the sun penetrates to the floor of the canyon, thus offering much better photography), consists of trips back and forth through the canyon following the light to capture the images when the sun best illuminates certain areas, and they are more expensive than the Regular tours.
We chose the Photographic tour with Adventurous Antelope Canyon Tours which we contacted at a dusty stand on Arizona highway 98, a few miles southeast of Page. After paying and waiting for the right time of day, our guide Josh drove the six of us in a Chevy Suburban the few miles to the canyon entrance. At least a mile (it seemed much longer) of it was over very rough terrain which tested the Suburban's suspension to its limit. While inside the canyon Josh was courteous and extremely helpful, offering many photographic hints and pointing out the best positions, POVs, even some exposure settings and constantly threw floor sand up in the air to accentuate the sun's rays.

<b>Suggestions:</b> 
Pay the extra money for the Photographic tour. 
Take a necessary tripod (our tour company offered them for an exorbitant rental fee).
Take extra batteries or make sure your camera batteries are fully charged (one member of our tour ran out of charge three pictures into the tour - you can imagine the disappointment).
Shoot only the widest lens you have (no time to change lenses and you wouldn't want to do so in the extremely dusty environment).
Use the time prior to your tour to affix a transparent plastic bag to your expensive gear and allow only the glass portion of the lens to be exposed to the dust.
Carry a blow brush to clean your lens periodically. 
The pictures are misleading - expect a crush of people in a very narrow canyon where very often you can touch both of its sides with your arms extended; and lastly.
Stay away from the company that gets you to the canyon on seats attached to the bed of a truck. If you go with them, your back will probably never be quite the same again.

If you are planning to visit and have additional questions, feel free to contact me via e-mail, better still, do so via an appropriate award, ha ha!"

Die <b>Saarschleife</b>, Durchbruchstal der Saar durch den Taunusquarzit, gehört zu den bekanntesten Sehenswürdigkeiten des Saarlandes. Die schönste Ansicht bietet der Aussichtspunkt Cloef im Mettlacher Ortsteil Orscholz, 180 m hoch über dem Fluss. Auch unmittelbar vom Saarufer aus bieten sich imposante Ausblicke. Steil zerklüftete Felswände wechseln mit Schutthalden und kleinen Schluchten ab.

Die Saarschleife beginnt kurz hinter Merzig beim Stadtteil Besseringen und endet in Mettlach. Die Luftlinie zwischen Besseringen und Mettlach beträgt nur etwa zwei Kilometer. Die Saar macht einen romantischen &quot;Umweg&quot;, der nahezu zehn Kilometer beträgt.

Auf dem bewaldeten Bergrücken innerhalb der Saarschleife befinden sich die Kirche St. Gangolf mit Teilen der ehemaligen Klosteranlage und die Burgruine Montclair. Einziger Ort in der Saarschleife ist das Dorf Dreisbach, wohin man mit einer Fähre übersetzen kann.

Die Saarschleife gilt als das Wahrzeichen des Saarlandes. Ins Rampenlicht rückte sie immer wieder, wenn Staatsoberhäupter sich dort einfanden: Friedrich Wilhelm IV., König von Preußen besuchte den Aussichtspunkt Cloef mit Blick auf die Saarschleife am 29. September 1856. Adolf Hitler besichtigte sie am 16. Mai 1939. Der Bundeskanzler Konrad Adenauer traf sich dort am 25. Juni 1965 mit saarländischen Politikern. Oskar Lafontaine und Gerhard Schröder wurden am 4. August 1997 an der Cloef mediengerecht mit der Saarschleife ins Bild gesetzt. Der französische Präsident Jacques Chirac und der polnische Präsident Lech Kaczynski trafen sich an der Saarschleife zum Dreiergipfel mit Bundeskanzlerin Angela Merkel am 5. Dezember 2006.

Pangas form the backbone of the small-scale fishing effort in Mexico, Central America and much of the Caribbean.

Pangas are usually between 19 and 28 feet in length, with capacities ranging from 1 to 5 tons and powered by outboard motors of between 45hp and 200hp. They are planing hulls capable of speeds in excess of 35 knots.

The hulls are made of Fiberglass or FRP, heavily reinforced by numerous bulkheads and usually have bow and stern enclosed flotation compartments.

In the hands of an experienced operator they are considered extremely seaworthy. Most pangas are expected to have a working life of between 5 to 10 years if properly maintained."

To prepare the game, I matched the color of select items around tenoversix’s courtyard to paint chips, like the ones you get at home depot. I then precisely cut the paint chips to match parts of the items I selected, thereby camouflaging the paint chip pieces.  When people arrived at the opening, they were instructed to go out into the courtyard and find the little paint chip bits.  When someone found one, they were instructed to bring it to me.  Then, I would redeem it for one of the gifts my mom gave me this past Christmas. The gifts have never been open, so it was a big surprise to use both. 

If you would me to set up Hidden Paintchip Fancy Gift at one of your parties, please feel free to contact me at marc (at) ineedtostopsoon (dot) com, and we can work something out.

The <b>Saar</b>  is a river in northeastern France and western Germany, and a right tributary of the Moselle River. It rises in the Vosges mountains on the border of Alsace and Lorraine, with two headstreams (Sarre Rouge and Sarre Blanche, united in Lorquin), that both start near Mont Donon, the highest peak of the northern Vosges. After 246 km (126 km in France and 120 km in Germany) the Saar flows into the Moselle River at Konz (Rhineland-Palatinate), having a catchment area of 7,431 km².

In former times, the Saar was very important for the Saarland industries of coal, iron and steel. Raw materials and finished products were shipped on it by water via the Saar Coal Canal, the Marne-Rhine Canal and the Rhine, for instance, to the Ruhrgebiet or the port of Rotterdam. Although the German part of the Saar has been upgraded to a waterway by deepening, construction of sluices and straightening, there is no significant shipping traffic.

Venecia is a budding photographer and this was her first day to set up a table and attempt to sell her prints. 

She was just as friendly as her big smile suggests and was a delight to get to photograph and talk with. Coming back by later I was able to meet her husband. They were both very nice people. Good Luck to them both.

A few days before I made this image, I noticed how the sun would soon be moving over each day until it was setting right behind this old eroded pier as the summer solstice approached.  So I knew to return to make a long exposure at sunset.  It is good to arrive at a location with an open mind because you never know what to expect.  I set aside my expectations and observe what elements attract the eye.  In the RAW file, this image had an overwhelming amount of color, so I had to de-saturate the sky in order to get back the details, which had become lost in blobs of bright orange.

In October of 2005, Hurricane Wilma scored a direct hit on this island with category 5 winds gusting over 200 miles per hour. Many beaches were stripped of their sand, revealing old features not seen in many years, like this old pier on the north side of the island. I was told that before the hurricane, these pilings were under many feet of sand and that the beach used to extend well past the last post seen here.

On the first day of my trip, the sun had set to the left of end of the pier, but I knew that over the next few days, the sun would move a little to the right each day.  (In landscape photography it pays to know how the natural world works, just as a bird photographer must know the habits of the birds to get the best shots.)  On the last day of my trip, the sun set right at the end of the pier.  I was ready and had an image in my head of what I hoped I could capture.  Fortunately the sun dropped below the clouds at the last minute and became visible right as the sun set.  I had taken photographs on the previous evenings just in case this evening turned out to be cloudy just to be on the safe side.  

So, I was lucky to be on vacation during this time, but the rest was planning!

Interest in this subject was sparked for me through reading &quot;Double Cross: The True Story of the D-Day Spies&quot; by Ben Macintyre. The book devotes a chapter to discussing the use of carrier pigeons in World War II. In discussing Nazi Germany's interest in pigeons, the author states:
<i>&quot;The Nazis incorporated pigeons into the very heart of the Reich: each of Germany's 57,000 pigeon fanciers had to have a certificate of political reliability from the Gestapo; Jews were banned from keeping pigeons, and the German Pigeon Federation was placed under the control of the SS. &quot;Himmler, who has been a pigeon fancier and enthusiast all his life, has brought his enthusiasm for pigeons into the Gestapo.&quot; it was reported. </i>

What a treat. I am putting together the movie for this trip, and found a dozen Ball of Light shots that I had not transfered into the right library. I thought I had done more work than it seemed. This was an all nighter.

It was a super rough night and the surface, as you can see, here was incredibly rough. It was a petrified forest floor, so the naughty Ball Of Light had to get a little too close to the edge. The ocean was deep, rough and super cold. 

Hope you are well.

Jackson County, North Carolina
Accessed via Bull Pen Road (gravel) from NC-107
Explore #194 on Thursday, August 4th - hugely unexpected; thanks guys!

I've got more Alaska in the que but I thought I would break it up a bit with some of my more traditional stuff from WNC.  I recently moved away from my place in South Carolina, and the Southern Appalachians in general.  It goes without saying that I miss many things about this area quite a bit.  Before I left I was in the process of scouting and shooting the Upper Chattooga Narrows, a place that quickly became a personal favorite for me in Western North Carolina for its off-the-map and adventurous feel.  Unfortunately, over the span of three or four visits I never really got ahold of the place in a photographic sense and figured out a composition that I was happy with.  However, I did fire off a number of shots and I guess it's fair to say that time and separation brought on by my recent move are bringing these shots back to the forefront.

The Upper Chattooga Narrows are a geologic feature in the headwaters region, section zero, of the Wild &amp; Scenic Chattooga River.  Surrounded by cliff walls, the river is pinched into a sluice that is as narrow as six feet or so in places.  The only way that I know of to access the area is by getting into the water, which at times was deeper than my waist.  I would love to return now when the summer temperatures have probably lowered the water levels a touch and it would be easier to wade the rapid areas safely to get some different comps!

I bought this camera from a thrift store for $9. To my surprise, it had fresh batteries and a roll of film inside. The film wasn't loaded, so I pulled it across and spooled it up. 

The meter seemed to be working correctly so I set the ISO 2 stops down to 100. I figured I had nothing to loose, so why not. 

I am really pleased with the first images I got from this little black slr that was originally sold at Sears in the 1970's, during the height of the toughskins era. Great center-weight metering camera.

I have a feeling my rangefinders may spend more time on the shelf now that I have starting playing with the familiar comfort, quality and speed of a single lens reflex again.

I am expecting great things from this camera."

The newest of the Outer Banks bunch, the Roanoke Marshes Light (which finished construction on September 25, 2004) is an exterior replica of the historic screwpile lighthouse that was decommissioned in 1955 and lost to the waters of the sound after an accident in transport while moving the Light from its prior location at the southern entrance of the Croatan Sound.  Screwpile is a term given to those lighthouses on wooden or steel piles that were &quot;screwed&quot; into the bottom of the sound; this design was extremely prevalent in North Carolina inland waters, as well as those of the Chesapeake Bay in Virginia.  Located in Shallowbag Bay along the Waterfront Park in Manteo, the Roanoke Marshes replica lighthouse is situated at the exact location where a waste treatement sewer tank once sat; seeing a before and after picture was pretty incredible--the improvement in scenic quality is noticeable to say the least!

While driving around the Outer Banks with fellow photographer and friend, <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/werksmedia"">Dave Allen</a>, the subject of distinguishing lighthouses was brought up in context of each having a unique paint scheme--the Hatteras Light with it's diagonal black and white stripes, the Bodie Island Light with it's horizontal black and white stripes, and the Currituck Beach Light with it's unpainted red brick exterior.  That is when I stumbled upon the word &quot;daymark&quot;:  a structure, lighthouse or not, that is easily identifiable and used by sailors for navigation.  Further, I learned that there are six different sizes, or orders, of Fresnel Lens, each helping to distinguish and identify an individual light station for sailors.  The Fresnel Lens takes a light source (a single ordinary house lightbulb in the case of the reconstructed Roanoke Marshes Light) and reflects the source outwards in all directions using hundreds of glass prisms.  Orders one through three (Bodie, Cape Hatteras, and Currituck all have 1st order Fresnel Lenses) are large, rotating lenses that can send varying flash sequences, while orders four through six (Roanoke Marshes is a 4th order Fresnel Lens) are smaller, fixed-beam lenses.  Because the Roanoke Marshes Lighthouse was a fourth order fixed beam fresnel lens, a fog horn or fog bell was used to distinguish the station while it was in operation.  "

<strong><u>I've been tagged (It was bound to happen)</u></strong>
.
So let's play that tag game, too many things you don't wanna know :
.
1. I'm 41 years old.
2. I work for the Belgian national gas company as a computer programmer.
   I've been programming for 18 years now, currently developing in C#.

3. I love cooking and people say I'm very good at it.

   Love Italian and Thai cuisine the most.
   My style of cooking could be describe as very spicey, not in the sense of hot but
   with plenty of herbs, packed with flavour.
   I never follow a recipe, only read it, put it away and just give it a personal twist.
   
   I cook dinner almost every evening.
   
4. I have 2 vertebrae discs which are too flat giving me backpains every single day.
   Some days are worse than others, I don't take painkillers for it (yet).
   
5. I'm addicted to music, love all kinds of music, but not all music, I think most commercial music is crap.
   
   Some of the styles I love:
   
   ° psychedelic
   ° space rock
   ° rock
   ° psychedelic rock
   ° jazz  ( the slow kind )
   ° blues ( the very rudimentary Mississipi Delta kind )
   ° Electronic.
   ° Classical music ( instrumental only ).
   ° Lounge
   ° Dub
   ° Industrial Metal (like Tool)
   
   Most people don't understand my music choice, because they stick to one category only.
   
6. I love walking but sometimes my one of my knees blocks and I can barely walk.
   The problem goes away by given the knee enough rest.

7. I used to be a very shy boy when I was young.

8. I've been wearing glasses since the age of 7.

9. I've practised shotokan karate for 8 years but had to stop because of 4, the problem
   with the knee could be a consequence of this as well.
   I had a brown belt and only needed to succeed in 2 more exams for a black belt.

10. I started drawing at the age of 17 and although I never had any art lessons was good
    at it from the start.
I do some oilpainting as well.
I make cut outs in MDF.
I make logos for companies.
I have my own company and website for all my artistic stuff : <a href=""http://www.erroba.be"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">www.erroba.be</a>.

11. I was a good skier 27 years ago ;) Never did it since.

12. I bought my first digital camera in june 2007 just before my second marriage.

13. Started really serious taking snaps (no not Schnapps ) when I discovered HDR in december 2007.

14. Joined flickr on january the 22th 2008.

16. I've just sold my first two images.
    It's about time ;)
    I've just been published with 6 photos in our local 'Mechelen Infogids 2009-2010'
    a local bi-annual info guide of Mechelen city which is freely distributed to all
homes in Mechelen and surrounding communities.
    I hope this will boost my sales a bit ;)

17. I think 16 points is way too few to actually tell much about one self.
    Sorry, I'll make it a bit more funny.

18. I regularly suffer from sinus infections, I had an operation to straigthen the
    inside of my nose in order to get rid of the reoccuring problem, it only gave
me improvement for the first two years.

The post operation days were a bit traumatic :

° Felt like suffocating when falling as sleep : The body has the natural reflex of breathing through the nose, but that was all closed with bandages...
° Sometimes you'll have to sneeze, you get medicine to avoid this, but they don't seem to be 100% full prove, guess what happens next... I'll spare you the details, please !
° It's only good for one thing, you loose 5 kilos in 5 days ! Can't be healthy.
  Everything taste the same : like nothing at all ! I have this theory 
  about people that will eat almost anything, they sure don't taste much ... ROFL. 
° Fifth day the bandages come off, guess what happens, I'll spare you the details again, please !
° First time you wipe your nose when you're back home, guess what happens, a plastic support frame comes out of your nose and it looks way too big to fit back in ! Sorry for those details, so please don't ask me about the previous ones, LOL !
  
19. I have a sleeping disorder. Catch about 3 to 4 hours of sleep every night.
    Guess what? I'm a bit weary from time to time.
Sometimes I catch some good sleep and wake up like a different person.

20. I'm a zombie in the morning due to 19 and despite of this I think my morning
    photoshoots have been the most productive ones.

21. I love a good glass of wine or a single malt wishky.
Stopped drinking wine in the evening since it is most likely the cause of 19.

22. I don't care if you're white, black, yellow, red or blue, gay or lesbian,
religious or not (*)

(*) Everything is ok with me as long as you don't cause any harm,
    which can be very debateable...

23. I like a good discussion which is based on descent sane arguments.

24. I'm over emotional and can shed a tear real quick.
Really troublesome sometimes.

25. I am way to honest ;)
    Also see 41.

26. 19 is caused by my overactive brain, can't make it stop to think.
Giving me plenty of difficult tasks is the key, I'll have them done
in no time and I actually sleep at night.
Can only work under pressure, only photography and art I do in a very
relaxed way, hell I need more !-)

27. I am a day-dreamer.

28. I have a short attention span due to 27 and 26.

29. I have a permenant ear damage due to too loud music in concerts nowadays.
    I always have custom made earplugs with me to ensure this will not get worse.
I have a constant peeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeep noise in my left ear which will never stop.

30. I am not afraid of what comes after my death, since I'm quite sure that will be nothing and at last I will no longer hear that peeeeeeeeeep noise again and have a good amount of 'sleep' ;)
Feels like heaven already !

31. I love absurd humor.

32. I love a good movie, a good book, Sci-fi and fantasy, art &amp; science.
Don't watch much TV, only documentaries and an occasional exception, I rarther
process a photo, <s>masturbate</s>, spend some time on flickr.

° note 1 : Masturbation doesn't make you blind, my eyes improved after the age of 7
               and no I wasn't masturbating before that age, ROFL and no I didn't start at 7
° note 2 : when the word 'flickr' is pronounced in Dutch is means gay guy, yes read it loud and clear: H-O-M-O-S-E-X-U-A-L so be aware dear flickr friends ( pun intended ) next time you give your business card to a man wearing a pink shirt, ROFL.
   Note : I'm not gay.
° note to myself : You can not be <b>that</b> honest !

33. Who is reading this shit, should <b>fave my shot</b>, ROFL !
I want my number 1 (Cries like a baby ;) )

34.I can be sarcastic from time to time.

35. There are a few things I hate about myself : If I get real angry I can shout real hard, 
       sorry I can't help it.  I can be very stubborn.

36. I have a very good visual memory but a lousy one in every other respect.
    Due to this, I can't usual remember what I was angry about in the first place ;)

Memory is mainly built up during sleep, give me complex tasks and I get better while
doing them, because my memory gets better too.

I've written programs that write programs for me, because the complex tasks get boring too, so the next thing I'll do is invent hard stuff for myself. Remember that all
my tools speed up my work and I have plenty of time.

You can hire me ;)

37. I believe in Zeus, Apollo, Ra, Thor, Baäl, Allah, God, Vaneshu...
    No seriously, I believe in one God less than you do, so I'm an Atheist.
I'm sure I've already lost a few contacts, comments and faves because of that,
some people have already blocked me because of this, I can only say one thing 'How religious of you !-)'
There I lost some more perhaps.

40. I think we still live in the middle ages.

    In a civilized world there is no place for :

° War
° Poverty
° Racism
° Sexism
° Corruption
° Child abuse
° Animal abuse
° Borders
° Organized religions
° Royalty
° Insurrance which is over expensive (also see my next point).
...

In a civilized world we would try to strive towards a single language.

All these things create groups, separation, friction, us and them, etc

People must play games and don't watch so much TV: it makes you sick.

41. Note for my insurrance : I'm a pathetical liar !

42. Is the answer to life and everything.

° For the people who read binary that's 101010, true false true false true false.
° For all other people, there are 10 people who can read binary :
  Those who can and those who can't.
  
I'm 41 !

Banksy is a pseudonymous British graffiti artist. He is believed to be a native of Yate, South Gloucestershire, near Bristol and to have been born in 1974, but his identity is unknown. According to Tristan Manco, Banksy &quot;was born in 1974 and raised in Bristol, England. The son of a photocopier technician, he trained as a butcher but became involved in graffiti during the great Bristol aerosol boom of the late 1980s.&quot; His artworks are often satirical pieces of art on topics such as politics, culture, and ethics. His street art, which combines graffiti writing with a distinctive stencilling technique, is similar to Blek le Rat, who began to work with stencils in 1981 in Paris and members of the anarcho-punk band Crass who maintained a graffiti stencil campaign on the London Tube System in the late 1970s and early 1980s. His art has appeared in cities around the world. Banksy's work was born out of the Bristol underground scene which involved collaborations between artists and musicians.

Since the late 1800s, the beach at Lovers Point in Pacific Grove has been a popular spot for boating and swimming, and over recent decades surfers have joined the mix. Lovers Point Park has above all become Pacific Grove's best-loved spot for picnics, plein air painting, and scenic photography.

5574495319,"Lifetime Dream # 35 of my list of 155: I will own a coffee and dessert café, serving freshly brewed coffees from around the world, espressos, and cappuccinos.  I will serve high quality desserts from recipes I have used and designed over the years.  I will serve a small variety of dinner and lunch foods and beverages, such as Greek and Italian salads, sandwiches, quiches, and Italian sodas.  The cafe will have a warm atmosphere, and a small staging area where musicians can perform good music inside.  In addition there will be an outside seating area, prospering beautiful hill country views and beautiful environments.

There is a small café in the town of St. Albert, Alberta (Canada) that was a major inspiration to me.  The café was always a wonderful place to stop for a nice cup of coffee (which was especially needed from the cold Canadian days!), and they served such wonderful desserts as well.  They served the best blueberry cream pie that I have ever had, and they always had such a wonderful variety of pies, cakes, sandwiched, and cheesecakes.

I’m such a fan of Starbucks, however they are a pretty universal and quite the commercial company.  I love the idea of a nice and cozy café with wonderful food and drink, and the availability of live music.  It’s tough to run such an enterprise, and I have no intention of running the everyday functions of the café- simply fronting the money and ideas for the café.  

I’d love to run it as a ministry of sorts, blessing people who have a great need for a job and want to be given a second chance- and a chance for a great future.  I’d love to run the business to make maybe a little bit of money, but mostly let the employees get the majority of the profits!

This dream is a ways away of course, but I have every intention of seeing it happen!  The dessert pictured… does NOT have a future to speak of!

6142969959,"<b>Thun </b> is a municipality in the administrative district of Thun in the canton of Bern in Switzerland with about 42,136 inhabitants (near 90,000 in the agglomeration), as of 1 January 2006.

It is located where the River Aar flows out of Lake Thun (Thunersee), 30 km south of Bern. Besides tourism, machine and precision instrument engineering, the largest garrison in the country, the food industry and publishing are of economic importance to Thun.

The area of what is now Thun was inhabited since the Neolithic age (mid-3rd millennium BC). The name of the city derives from the Celtic term Dunum, meaning &quot;fortified city&quot;. It fell to Rome in 58 BC, when Roman legions conquered almost all of Switzerland, and it soon became one of the main centres of Roman administration in the region.

The Romans were driven out of Thun, and out of the rest of Switzerland, by the Burgundians around 400 AD. The Aar became the frontier between the Christian Burgundians and the Pagan, German-speaking Alemanni, who lived north. Thun was mentioned for the first time during the 7th century, in the chronicle of Frankish monk Fredgar.

The region of Thun became a part of the Holy Roman Empire in 1033, when Conrad II gained the title of King of Burgundy. The emperors entrusted the Zähringen family, centred in Bern, with subduing the unruly nobles of central Switzerland. Around 1190 Duke Bertold V of Zähringen, built a castle in Thun and expanded the city. After Bertold's death in 1218, his territories went to Ulrich III von Kyburg.

In 1264 Thun received state rights and in 1384 the town was bought by the canton of Bern. Thun was the capital of the Oberland canton of the Helvetic Republic.

In 1819 a Military School was founded in the city, which later developed into the main military school in Switzerland. Thun was connected to the railway network of Switzerland in 1859 and telephone access made available in 1888.

Sometimes us &quot;old people&quot; are a bit too old-fashioned and rigid for my liking -- the lack of rigidity in children, and their willingness to let themselves be guided completely by curiosity and intuition is one of my favourite qualities to observe in them.

Rather than following a pesky and wildly inaccurate calendar (and trying to to apply a discreet December or June Summer Solstice to to one's location on a continuous grid of coordinates), children just <i>know</i>:

When they can sense the relief and increasingly happy aura around them, <i>summer has begun</i>. When they are free to do <i>whatever they want</i>, unimpeded by the weather or schedules, <i>summer has begun</i>. When some mysterious, uncontrollable force within them shoves them out the door and into the nearest freezing cold pool of water, <i>THAT</i> is when summer has begun. 

They just know! They have no old-fashioned date systems, calculations based on axial tilts, or other technicalities to hold them back -- they let their intuition guide them, and it serves them well. I love it! :D"

Prayer wheel

Prayer Wheels are a manifestation of the Compassion Buddha's holy speech. Turning the prayer wheel with bodhichitta motivation while reciting the 6-syllable mantra will allow &quot;one to collect more extensive merit to quickly achieve enlightenment than an arhat who abides for many years in the blissfull state of peace for oneself alone.&quot; (Lama tubten Zopa Rinpoche) &quot;..in the text by the 4th Panchen Lama, I translated a section in which Amitabha Buddha says, 'Anyone who recites the six syllables while turning the Dharma wheel at the same time is equal in fortune to the Thousand Buddhas,' and in which Shakyamuni Buddha says that turning the prayer wheel once is better than having done one, seven, or nine years of retreat.&quot; (Lama Thubten Zopa Rinpoche from the forward to WHEEL OF GREAT COMPASSION~ The Practice of the Prayer Wheel in Tibetan Buddhism by Lorne Ladner.

Prayer wheels can be tiny things that a Buddhist carries with them or enormous objects up to nine feet high found in monasteries.
These physical prayer devices are very common in Tibetan Buddhist communities.

From Wikipedia:

Athabasca Falls in Jasper National Park is just 23 metres high. However, it is not known for its height. Instead it is known for the force of the falling water due to the quantity of water flowing. Even on a cold morning in the fall, copious amounts of water flow over the falls. A layer of hard quartzite has allowed the falls to cut into the softer limestone below carving the short gorge and a number of potholes. White water rafting often starts below the falls to travel downstream on the Athabasca River to Jasper, Alberta.

It is a class 5 waterfall, with a drop of 80 ft (24 m) and a width of 60 ft (18 m).[1]

7256450076,"Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument has been called the most dangerous park in America, most notably because of the death of ranger Kris Eggle in August of 2002 when park officials clashed with Mexican drug cartel members. Much of the park has been closed for years as trafficking of drugs and people along the border escalated. If you are interested, read this article as it does a better job than I ever could explaining the current problems and emerging solutions the park is implimenting to keep visitors safe. Make up your own mind if it’s worth it to venture down there. I’ll not be sued because I endorsed it to be safe. It is a strange place to visit. We stepped into the visitor’s center and were warned to not take the full Ajo Mountain Drive Loop Road as it was too late in the day. After a lengthy drive in and literally nowhere to stay remotely close by, we were gonna see this place.

It is admittedly a little creepy. You can see the border lights from the visitor center and with all the talk of drug cartel violence getting thrown around, you stick close to the car. Still, after a bit you don’t think every bush will have someone jumping out at you. America sells that paranoia well.

We were hoping to get a variety of wildflowers to use a subjects against the organ pipes. Brittlebush was the only option on this trip and I finally found a composition that I liked with colorful yellow patches leading off into the distance. I found the landscape particularly difficult to compose. Saguaros are just easier subjects as they have more verticality and become more visually distinct as the arms branch out. Organ Pipes are just a jumble of leading vertical lines and I always seemed to end up with a scraggly cholla peeking its way into my shot. Finally, somewhere between Arch Canyon and Bull Pasture I got something I liked as the sun was going down.

Ajo Mountain Drive becomes a one way route at the first split. It was getting dark and even I am not crazy enough to want to be that far away from the ranger station after dark. The real excitement of the trip was after we got back. Dave wanted to do some light painting on the saguaros close to the visitor center. The ambient light is minimal out there and the stars were out in force. After a few attempts, we got a little bolder and went back across the road on foot to see what we could find. The moon was coming up between a saguaro’s arms. I was hooked. So now you have two oblivious dudes with headlamps in the bushes lighting up the resident cactus near the road but just enough out of site. You see where this is going? Awareness struck like lightening when we heard the car door shut. Crap, I’m gonna get shot by rangers while being a complete idiot. How would I ever explain this to my wife? So, we sat in silence expecting at any time to be shuffled off for questioning at gunpoint. After five or so minutes of nothing happening, we decided the best course of action was to be noisy in case they were sneaking up. So, we acted as gringo as we possibly could.

Me: “Man, I’m having real trouble selling my house.” (nearly shouting)

Dave:”Is it because it’s in a gated community?”

I’m not sure why, but nothing happened. Nothing at all. So, we packed up our gear and headed out hoping to catch something still open for dinner in Ajo.

Well, I'm not so sure that the super moon ended up being all THAT super, but it was fun to watch it rise.  Fortunately, we had some light clouds (and probably pollution) that gave it a great orange color and kept it from blowing out in the completely dark sky.  If only it had risen about 30 minutes earlier!  What was super, however, was an app on my iPad that showed me exactly where and when the moon would rise over this temple in Lilburn, Georgia.  It uses Google Earth and superimposes sunrise, sunset, moonrise and moonset angles over any location for any day and time.  Since it showed the moon rising right behind the temple and I didn't have any other location scouted out, I decided to head out and check it out.  (The app is called &quot;LightTrac&quot; if anyone is interested and so far it really works great.)

This is one exposure.  A click definitely makes it more worthwhile to see larger on black.   I probably need to work on lightening up for the temple a little but for now this will have to do.  Sorry I haven't been commenting lately, but I have been keeping up with everyone's images.  Will try and get caught up soon."

Analogue photography doesn't have to dodge behind digital photography. I think nowadays you can still get some very cool shots that are of high quality and rich in detail. 
I don't like how people see film photography in the way that these weird iPhone Filter-apps present the whole thing.  That's too overdrawn and stereotyped for me. When I use a film camera, I always see it as a challenge of making a technically perfect shot that could be compared to a digital photograph, without all these overstated alienations.

The Story
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The rainy season is just beginning in California.  In the past couple of weeks, we have had one good day of rain and a few others with a few sprinkles.  The last rains were in April.  So as a new storm approached, I decided to head out to the beach to see some real clouds, not just the regular summer fog.  I had to keep driving down the coast in order to stay ahead of the thick clouds and I ended up 50 miles south from my intended destination.  Finally, I ended up at &quot;Hole in the Wall Beach&quot; a favorite local photo spot.  You have to walk through a beautiful sea arch to get here.  It pays to keep track of the weather in situations like this because you can move to a more favorable location!

When I see a rocky outcrop like this, I often wonder how long it has been here, standing up to storms and surf.  100 years? 1,000? 10,000? 1 million? More?  Since coastal erosion takes so much time at rocky locations like this, it really makes you think of the immense stretches of time required to carve out a scenic stretch of coast like this.  It makes me realize how small I am compared to everything.  This sense of smallness is obvious in a place like a deep canyon, a volcano or an ice-sculpted mountain.  However, even a simple rock extending into the sea can spur the imagination to wonder what stories it would tell!

If you want to see the slightly different scene that I saw 2 hours after this, see here:

&quot;Washington was an early supporter of religious toleration and freedom of religion...When hiring workmen for [his residence in] Mount Vernon [Virginia], he wrote to his agent, 'If they be good workmen, they may be from Asia, Africa, or Europe; they may be Mohammedans [Muslims], Jews, or Christians of any sect, or they may be Atheists.'&quot;

This is my first day shooting birds.. . i must admit that shooting birds is much more difficult than i thought!! i kept running &amp; chasing birds trying to catch a good photo heheheheh . . 

i discovered that i need a hide plan &amp; some food to attract birds. and ofcourse IR remote release or a long cable (maybe) for my wired remote release cable. 

It was fun, i took lots of photos, most of them were rubish :)
when i desided to post at least one to Flickr, i found the above photo is acceptable in terms of shrpness &amp; frozen action. . .  (it's not perfect though)

I'm looking forward to catch better ones next time.. . .

This is a strange sunset phenomena I see once in awhile.  The rays such as these here are actually not in the west but are in the east as the sun goes down.  They appear to be related to shadows cast by clouds based on this image, but if anyone knows what this effect is called or can explain why it does this-- please do.

Note:the rays were not added in photoshop, I emphasized them here with a blend of hdr and non-hdr layers to create the final result. A total of two hdr images composed from 8 exposures 1 ev apart and two original frames were used to create the final result that best shows off the rays in the east to my tastes."

<strong><u>About</u></strong>

Agyrophobia is the fear of streets or the fear of crossing the street.

3rd in my series of phobia :

<a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/erroba/2416581080/"">Aquaphobia</a>
<a href=""http://flickr.com/photos/erroba/2379990878"">Claustrophobia</a>

<strong><u>The shot</u></strong>

11 x Standard 3 exposures HDR on a tripod using the Sigma 10-20mm lens (with polarizer) in a vertical position.

<strong><u>Photomatix</u></strong>

I tonemapped one file and saved the settings so I could use the same for all shots.
The tonemapping of all 11 shots ( 33 photos ) was done before the stitching process.

<strong><u>Stitching</u></strong>

Stitched with autostitch.
Stitching shots made with a wide angle is not the obvious thing to do, but I chose the 20mm range and held the camera in a vertical position, this not only reduces the perspective distortion problem that makes stitching troublesome or even impossible but has also the advantage of having more vertical resolution to spare which can be a problem when needing to crop the curvatures that always occurs ( hence you see so many very flat panoramas ).

I used more overlap than what one should do with a 'normal' lens, 50% or so.

<strong><u>Photoshop</u></strong>

In the original stitch the middle part of the building bulged too much to the front ( in my opinion ), although the bulging is what I was after. So here's what I did : 
First a spherical distortion with 'Horizontal Only' selected, 25%, after this I stretched the image width 110%.

The street stones were way too blue, also a thing you could expect with long exposure times and clear blue sky, I used a color balance to fix this and masked everthing else out ( not the van on the right, that was also too blue ).

The back lights of the parked cars looked like they were shining, so I desatured the image, inversed the mask ( Ctrl-I ) and painted over the lights with a small white brush.

The sky looked too light so I used the hue/saturation/lightness to add some saturation to it and to darken it. I made a mask by going to the channels, picked the blue channel ( which should be the obvious choice, since the sky is completely blue but not much else is ), copied that channel and pasted it into the mask of the hue/saturation/lightness. Then used levels (Ctrl-L) to force the black/white to a maximum, making the sky completely white and almost all the rest completely black, the things that remained I painted manually to black.

Did a bit of dodging on a few parts of the wall that looked too dark.

Added the frame around it using a prerecorded action that I always use for that.

A smart sharpen filter on the background.

There were a few small artifacts of the stitching process that didn't seem 100% ok, small aligment problems that were visible on the top of the building and the border of footpath, so I manually smudged them in place.

Flattened everything, copied the middle section of the image and pasted it, then made a free transform ( Ctrl-T ) and clicked on the icon with the curved mesh, to be able to control the deformation percisely, this made the frame bulge outwards aswell.

Added the text and transformed that using the same technique and finally added my logo.

<strong><u>You</u></strong>

I'm fifteen for a moment
Caught in between ten and twenty
And I'm just dreaming
Counting the ways to where you are
 
I'm twenty two for a moment
She feels better than ever
And we're on fire
Making our way back from Mars 

Fifteen there's still time for you
Time to buy and time to lose
Fifteen, there's never a wish better than this
When you only got hundred years to live ...

I'm thirty three for a moment
Still the man, but you see I'm of age
A kid on the way
A family on my mind 

I'm forty five for a moment
The sea is high
And I'm heading into a crisis
Chasing the years of my life 

Fifteen there's still time for you
Time to buy, time to lose yourself
Within a morning star 

Fifteen I'm all right with you
Fifteen, there's never a wish better than this
When you only got hundred years to live 

Half time goes by
Suddenly you're wise
Another blink of an eye
Sixty seven is gone
The sun is getting high
We're moving on ...

I'm ninety nine for a moment
Dying for just another moment
And I'm just dreaming
Counting the ways to where you are 

Fifteen there's still time for you
Twenty two I feel her too
Thirty three you're on your way
Every day's a new day ....

Fifteen there's still time for you
Time to buy and time to choose
Hey fifteen, there's never a wish better than this

<b>Some Origins of Fire</b>
Cars crash through the streets
The west end waves break city heats
The east coast storms fill in the sky
Winter weekends
Cold, unbearable
Lifes so terrible
Shots ring out in blind stellar night time
Town lights come alive like a land mine
Eyes wide up in five second intervals
Unpredictable, lifes a miracle

We all are love and love is hard
Were hard to love
We all are love and love is hard
It breaks my heart
We all are love and love is hard
Were hard to love
We all are love and love is hard
So heres my heart

I cant close my eyes
The east end barrels, its summer time
The west coast lives got butterflies
So literal
Cold, unbearable
Life's so terrible
Kids live fearlessly and curious lives
Grow up to be so serious
Lost time, broken dreams
So usual
Unpredictable, life's a miracle

It's only the cycle
It's deafening though
This age old recital is king of all sounds
There is no release, free, we are silently numb
A sole, lonely wave with the weight that's yet to come

7067658413,"Wikipedia defines a blivit (or blivet) as &quot;an undecipherable figure, an optical allusion and an impossible object.&quot; 

 In military slang, blivit means 10 pounds of manure in a 5 pound bag. 

I prefer Kurt Vonnegut's definition. He believes the term blivits should refer to books combining both fiction and fact, &quot;an all-frequencies assault on the sensibilities.&quot; 

I like that definition, and I think it applies to night photography especially well. Star trails are real, they are fact, but try as I might, I've never been able to look up at the sky and tell the stars are streaking across it. The light painting is also real enough, although it never existed like you see it in the picture above. I lit the yellow, then the blue, and then I ran and lit the pink. Someone watching would never have seen all three colors at once. They are just a figment of my imagination caught on camera. 

Anyway, this is about fifty 20 second exposures stacked for the star trails and one 79 second exposure for the building and foreground. I used an sb-600 with colored gels for the interior colors, and the rest is just light from a nearly full moon.

Oh yea, if you want to have your mind blown, stare at <a href=""http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/84/Poiuyt.svg"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">this</a> blivet from Wikipedia for a little bit."

But you will remember this time...

5549353568,"As most of us do, I started the drive out to Monument Valley filled with hope and excitement for a glorious, epic sunrise.  And as happens with most of us far too often, I got completely skunked.  In fact, conditions for most of my trip to AZ/UT were less than stellar (but I still had an incredible time seeing beautiful things).  This is the sunrise I got, so this is the sunrise I shot.  Some subtle violet tones in an otherwise gray sky, but geez--MONUMENT VALLEY.  I don't think I stopped saying &quot;wow&quot; for about half an hour (it was my first trip there).  I find it truly amazing that these two buttes have eroded this way, making a matched set of mittens.

Since I was limited on what I could shoot (and I do still have a couple of nice ones from the trip I'm working on), I enjoyed the sights and did a LOT of scouting for future trips.  Can't wait to get back."

So that means, trying to get christmas gifts before the fast approaching deadline, drinking ‘glühwein’ and of course to delight  in the wonderful christmas decoration all around the town. So I went out to get some of the first impressions of this years’ pre-christmas season. Ok, it’s not that cold yet and there wasn’t any snow, but I don’t mind, considering it might get too cold for my camera and me at some point. On that day, I wanted a shot with some nice decorations in the background and someone with a thick scarf or a cap, so you can get the feeling of winter.

Earlier that day, I saw a girl I wanted to take a picture of, but didn’t manage to get near her, since I saw her from too far away, her also heading away from me. But luckily, I saw her (at least I believe it was her…) a good hour later coming towards me, also near a place where I could get my background as wished. So I was a bit nervous, because I really wanted that shot on that location with that person. I was very happy, when she agreed, and really hoped, that the image would be good enough to get published. I think it is, so thank you for letting me photograph you."

5175971008,"<b>Parlamento de Austria</b>


El Parlamento de Austria (Österreichisches Parlament) está compuesto por dos cámaras:

Nationalrat (consejo nacional) y
Bundesrat (consejo federal).

La composición del Nationalrat se determina cada cuatro años mediante elecciones generales. El consejo nacional es la cámara dominante en la legislación austríaca.
El Bundesrat está constituido por los Landtagen individuales. (Parlamento de los Estados de la República Federal). El Bundesrat posee el derecho a un veto de dilación en muchos casos, que sólo una fuerte y persistente resolución del consejo nacional puede ratificar.
El Bundesversammlung se compone de los miembros de ambas cámaras del parlamento y se reúne únicamente en contadas ocasiones.
El edificio del parlamento es el Ringstraße en Viena. Es uno de los edificios más famosos y céntricos de la ciudad y se construyó durante el gobierno de Theophil von Hansen durante los años 1874-1883. Hansen concentró en un edificio de estilo griego clásico, la sede del gobierno de Austria. Delante del edificio del Parlamento, se encuentra la estatua de la diosa de la sabiduría de la mitología griega, Pallas Atenea o Minerva, la diosa griega de la paz y el conocimiento. 
Sobre sus manos sostiene a Nike, la victoria alada.
Las dos rampas que dan acceso a la puerta principal están flanqueadas por estatuas dedicadas a hombres de estado griegos y romanos. En el centro, anteponiéndose al edificio hay unas esculturas de bronce, Los Domadores de Caballos.
Durante la monarquía austrohúngara, el edificio albergó el Reichsrat de Cisleithania.

Vestrahorn, West-Horn, is a mountain on the promontory between Skarðsfjörður and Papafjörður, visible from Stokknes. The steep slopes are made of gabbro-rock, which is a kind of granite, so is probably, one of the few mountains in Iceland that is not made of volcanic material.
Anyway is one of the oldest mountains in the SouthEast  region of Iceland and reaches a height of 454 meters (1500 feet).

It was a windy afternoon, the clouds were passing by very fast, the artic terns were flying around. The colours were amazing.

Del cualquier modo, es una de las montañas más antiguas de la región sureste de Islandia y alcanza una altura de 454 metros (1500 pies).

Era una tarde de mucho viento, las nubes pasaban muy rápido, los charranes árticos volaban alrededor. Los colores eran increíbles.

2328264708,"A <b>dragonfly</b> is an insect belonging to the order Odonata, the suborder <b>Epiprocta</b> or, in the strict sense, the infraorder <b>Anisoptera</b>. It is characterized by large multifaceted eyes, two pairs of strong, transparent wings, and an elongated body.

<b>Dragonflies</b> typically eat mosquitoes, midges, and other small insects like flies, bees, and butterflies. They are therefore valued as predators, since they help control populations of harmful insects. Dragonflies are usually found around lakes, ponds, streams and wetlands because their larvae, known as &quot;nymphs&quot;, are aquatic. Dragonflies do not normally bite or sting humans, though they will bite in order to escape, if grasped by the abdomen."

Viver

Historia:
Existen evidencias de poblamientos humanos en el periodo paleolítico superior en la cueva del Sargal.
El primer dato histórico documentado que tenemos de Viver es que Marco Poncio Catón fundó esta localidad, con el nombre de Belsino, en el 193 a.C., posteriormente los mismos romanos le cambiaron el nombre por Vivarium, del que deriva el actual, llegando a ser una de las más populares ciudades de la Celtiberia, por haberse convertido en un ameno lugar de placer y recreo.

En torno a 1237-1239 fue conquistada a los árabes por el rey Jaime I de Aragón; este rey, el 24 de abril de 1244, concedió a la población el título de Real Villa, y el 12 de abril de 1367 se le otorga la Carta Puebla por Juan Alonso, donde se la declara población independiente.             
Posteriormente esta villa va siendo heredada, devuelta al Rey y finalmente vendida al Duque de Calabria, Virrey de Valencia en 1537; el 26 de octubre de 1550 murió el Duque, legando sus bienes al monasterio de San Miguel de los Reyes en Valencia, fundado por él, y los religiosos toman posesión de Viver.

Usually it takes quite some time for me to find another stranger, after just shooting  one.But this time, I said goodbye to one person (whose portrait is not published yet) and the moment after that, I saw this man coming off a pedestrian underpass. It took me just one look to know, that I have to ask him for a portrait. He was very positive all the way with my project and very willing to be a part of it, and I think you can see that in his face, his expression is one of a very optimistic person. Thanks a lot for the picture."

MY SECRET PLACE

Where curlews cry, and sheep  bleat
Where hills  gaze 
On mortals weak
Silent pond is hidden here
Well away from human eye
Sky so vast and near the sun
This is where you must come
Walk the paths
See the  space
Shadows on the pond
Stunted trees and fossil stones
Talk awhile
Touch the trees
Breathe the air
Hear spirits sing
An ancient place
That time forgot
Haunted by the past

Our secret place
Where curlews cry

I´ve been thinking about doing this shot in bw for a long time. And today was the day to do it. 

This was from the beginning just a shot for fun as I was only out for the swan at the time. But as time passes this photograph suddenly means more to me than the one I was after from the beginning. (Story about the shot is on the other swan page). 

I´m getting more and more into storytelling as it gives me a bigger personal satisfaction and a sense of  photographical purpose. I made contact with this woman because of the camera, and we became friends even if it lasted for a short time. It was a great feeling, because without my camera I would just have passed her, I would never heard her story...

En Estados Unidos, el juego se hizo popular en 1984, año en que se vendieron alrededor de 20 millones de ejemplares. Parker Brothers (ahora parte de Hasbro) compró los derechos del juego en 1988. Hasta 2004, se han vendido cerca de 88 millones de ejemplares, en 26 países y 17 idiomas.

<b>Juego de mesa - Tablero y reglas</b>

Las reglas del juego son las siguientes:
El tablero está compuesto por casillas que forman una rueda con seis radios. Cada casilla lleva el color de un tipo de preguntas, con una casilla especial de cada color en el lugar en que los radios se unen a la rueda, donde aparece el quesito del respectivo color sostenido por dos querubines.
La edición Genus está compuesta por 4800 preguntas y respuestas en 800 tarjetas, 6 fichas de jugador, 36 cuñas de puntuación (quesitos), un dado y un tablero. Se recomienda para personas de 10 años en adelante y pueden llegar a jugar de 2 a 36 jugadores (jugando en equipos de hasta 6 participantes). Los temas tienen un código de colores en la edición Genus: azul (geografía), rosa (espectáculos), amarillo (historia), marrón (arte y literatura), verde (ciencias y naturaleza) y naranja (deportes y pasatiempos).
Los jugadores comienzan en el centro de la rueda. Lanzan los dados en orden y mueven sus fichas con forma de queso en la dirección que elijan, el número de casillas que indica el dado. Tras mover la ficha, otro jugador coge una carta del mazo y hace al jugador que ha movido la ficha una pregunta que se corresponde con el color de la casilla a la que la ficha ha ido a parar. Si el jugador la responde correctamente puede tirar el dado de nuevo. Si la casilla es una de las casillas especiales situadas en la intersección, obtiene como premio una de las seis cuñas (popularmente llamadas &quot;quesitos&quot;) del color de la casilla, si es que no la ha conseguido ya. Si el jugador responde incorrectamente, el turno pasa al siguiente jugador.
El juego prosigue hasta que un jugador obtiene los quesitos de los seis colores y se dirige al centro. Una vez que llega allí el jugador debe responder una pregunta final, cuyo color escogen los rivales. Si la responde correctamente, gana el juego. Si no, se sigue jugando hasta que alguien lo consiga. Es común que, para ganar la partida, en vez de tener que responder una pregunta final a elegir por los rivales valga con responder correctamente cuatro de las seis preguntas de una tarjeta elegida al azar. También es común aplicar una regla en la que si un jugador cae en una casilla especial de premio de cuña (quesito) habiendo conseguido anteriormente esa cuña, si responde incorrectamente, puede perder esa cuña ganada.

5676321521,"No, not the guy in the hat, the guy standing up in the background (mouseover). I went to <a href=""http://www.sunfest.com/"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">SunFest</a> yesterday. This is s huge annual music and arts festival in downtown West Palm Beach and usually a good place for photos. So I see this dude in the red-white-blue funnyhat and start working to get a decent shot of him. I'm hoping for a interesting group of people that will add some context. I take about a dozen shot from different angles then decide it's not a great subject and start to walk away when Mr. Asshole comes over to me and says, &quot;What are you doing...you're creeping people out taking pictures&quot; I said &quot;What?!&quot; He walks closer with his wife in tow and says, &quot;You're creeping people out taking pictures of girls and kids. Every time kids walk by I see you taking pictures.&quot; I said &quot;Excuse me, I am taking pictures of the guy in the hat&quot;. He comes even closer and starts getting in my face. There is a security guy in a golf cart nearby and he looks over to him and says &quot;this guy is over there taking pictures of kids, I think you should call a cop&quot; The security guy was cool and just wanted to defuse the situation so I walked over and sat down in his golf cart and said, &quot;yeah, I think you should call a cop&quot;. Knowing full well what my rights are and knowing that this asshole didn't have a clue of what I was actually seeing in-camera, I knew I would be vindicated, which I was. What I was not prepared for was the first question the cop asked when he arrived. &quot;Are you a sexual offender?&quot; I said &quot;What?????&quot; He repeated, &quot;are you a registered sexual offender?&quot; I said &quot;Noooo, I'm a photographer. And I have a perfect right to take photographs in a public place&quot; The cop asked for my drivers license and got on his walkie talkie. After about a minute he handed it back to me and said, &quot;okay you can go, sorry for the inconvenience&quot;. He went over to talk to asshole and I sort of sneered over my shoulder as I walked away.

In retrospect I am satisfied with the outcome of what could have been a bad situation. But in some ways I am furious with myself for not just telling the asshole to f@*ck off and mind his own business. This happened just days after <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/groups/instruction30/discuss/72157626592577252/"">Kate Cooper's incident</a> in the UK. 

Anyway, <a href=""http://www.orchidworks.com/SunFest/content/index.html"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow""><b>here is a gallery</b></a> of ten of the dozen shots I took of the hat guy. Judge for yourself how the asshole could remotely think I was taking pix of women and children. I didn't even realize the he was watching me the whole time until I looked through the shots.

Entre 1801 et 1804, une passerelle de neuf arches en fonte réservée aux piétons est construite à l'emplacement de l'actuel pont des Arts : c'est le premier pont métallique de Paris. Cette innovation est due au premier consul Napoléon Bonaparte, suivant une réalisation anglaise. Les ingénieurs Louis-Alexandre de Cessart et Jacques Dillon conçoivent cette passerelle pour ressembler à un jardin suspendu, avec des arbustes, des bacs de fleurs et des bancs.
En 1852, suite à l'élargissement du quai de Conti, les deux arches de la rive gauche deviennent une seule arche.
Le pont était soumis à un droit de péage2. Ainsi, dans le roman La Rabouilleuse, d'Honoré de Balzac, Philippe Bridau « faisait cirer ses bottes sur le Pont-Neuf pour les deux sous qu'il eût donnés en prenant par le pont des Arts pour gagner le Palais-Royal »3.
En 1976, l'inspecteur général des Ponts et Chaussées rapporte la fragilité de l'ouvrage, principalement due aux bombardements des Première et Seconde Guerres mondiales et à plusieurs collisions de bateaux en 1961 et 1970.
Le pont sera fermé à la circulation en 1977 et s'effondrera effectivement sur 60 mètres en 1979 lors d'un dernier choc avec une barge.
Le pont actuel a été reconstruit entre 1981 et 1984 « à l'identique » selon les plans de Louis Arretche, qui a diminué le nombre des arches (sept au lieu de neuf), ce qui permet leur alignement sur celles du pont Neuf, tout en reprenant l'aspect de l'ancienne passerelle. La passerelle a été inaugurée par Jacques Chirac – alors maire de Paris – le 27 juin 1984.
Les restes de l'ancien pont sont installés dans le port de plaisance de Nogent-sur-Marne, où ils sont toujours visibles.
Servant parfois de lieu d'exposition, c'est aujourd'hui un lieu attirant les peintres, dessinateurs et photographes (pour son point de vue unique), mais aussi les amateurs de pique-niques durant l'été.
À la fin des années 1990, un projet de construction de passerelle piétonnière franchissant le Kamogawa à Kyoto, au Japon, a été développé en prenant comme modèle le pont des Arts ; il ne fut néanmoins pas mené à son terme devant l'opposition de la population4."

Con una rosa, hai detto,
vienimi a cercare
tutta la sera io resterò da sola!
Ed io per te
muoio per te
con una rosa sono venuto a te

bianca come le nuvole di lontano
come una notte amara passata invano
come la schiuma che sopra il mare spuma
bianca non è la rosa che porto a te

gialla come la febbre che mi consuma
come il liquore che strega le parole
come il veleno che stilla dal tuo seno
gialla non è la rosa che porto a te

sospirano le rose nell'aria spirano
petalo a petalo mostrano il color
ma il fiore che da solo cresce nel rovo
rosso non è l'amore
bianco non è il dolore
il fiore solo è il dono che porto a te

rosa come un romanzo di poca cosa
come la resa che affiora sopra al viso
come l'attesa che sulle labbra pesa
rosa non è la rosa che porto a te

come la porpora che infiamma il mattino
come la lama che scalda il tuo cuscino
come la spina che al cuore si avvicina
rossa così è la rosa che porto a te

lacrime di cristallo l'hanno bagnata
lacrime e vino versate nel cammino
goccia su goccia, perdute nella pioggia
goccia su goccia le hanno asciugato il cuor

portami allora portami il più bel fiore
quello che duri più dell'amor per sè
il fiore che da solo non specchia il rovo
perfetto dal dolore
perfetto dal suo cuore
perfetto dal dono che fa di sè

The banks of the Grand Canal are lined with more than 170 buildings, most of which date to 13th to the 18th century and demonstrate the welfare and art created by the Republic of Venice. The noble Venetian families faced huge expenses to show off their richness in suitable palazzos: this contest reveals the citizens’ pride and the deep bond with the lagoon. Amongst the many are the Palazzi Barbaro, Ca' Rezzonico, Ca' d'Oro, Palazzo Dario, Ca' Foscari, Palazzo Barbarigo and to Palazzo Venier dei Leoni, housing the Peggy Guggenheim Collection. The churches along the canal include the basilica of Santa Maria della Salute. Centuries-old traditions such as the Historical Regatta are perpetuated every year along the Canal.

Because most of the city's traffic goes along the Canal rather than across it, only one bridge crossed the canal until the 19th century, the Rialto Bridge. There are currently two more bridges, the Ponte degli Scalzi and the Ponte dell'Accademia. A fourth, controversial bridge (Ponte della Costituzione) designed by Santiago Calatrava was recently erected, connecting the train station to the vehicle-open area of Piazzale Roma. As was usual in the past, people can still take a ferry ride across the canal at several points by standing up on the deck of a simple gondola called traghetto.
Most of the palaces emerge from water without pavement. Consequently, one can only tour past the fronts of the buildings on the grand canal by boat.

This one was a complete hit-and-run type photograph taken. No research, no transportation organised till the very last minute, barely making it to the site before the last light disappeared for the day. I guess sometimes improvisation supercedes good preparation regarding the outcome (As a German/Polish guys I really don't like to admit to that, though! LOL).

History, Facts &amp; Figures:
The building was designed and build by architect Howard Raggatt and formally opened on 11th March 2001. The post modern architecture is quite beautiful to look at in my opinion. The NMA (National Museum of Australia) profiles 50,000 years of Indigenous Heritage, the settlement period and major Australian events till today. The Museum has over 6,600 square metres of exhibiton space. Highly visible on the left-hand side in this photograph you are can see the 30meters high &quot;loop&quot; which depicts a line connecting the museum and directed towards Uluru.

Photographic Technique:
The picutre is a 12 shot double-horizontal-row panorama taken about 38min after sunset with a picture exposure of 30s at f/13.0 and ISO 100. I used DxO Optics 6 for the RAW file conversion, ens distortion optimisation as well as for contrast and detail enhancement. As usual Autopano Pro 2 did the stitching for me. I post-editied it in Bridge and Photoshop and framed in Photoshop CS5. Minimal Post processing was applied to the original.

Print:
The end-result is a 113 megapixel photograph which is printable  6.77m x 2.45m at 72 DPI (excl. black frame).

Because of the position of this flower and the wed ground, I decided to make this picture in the Automatic Live view mode. So all the settings were set by the camera...
I got a mirror from flipXbac on my LCD and position the focus square on the flower, to get that part sharp.

But.... my camera decided something completely different. The flower is out of focus and the trees in the back ground became in focus. I don't know why this happened. The result however, I do like more than the ones with the flower in focus..

A blurry spring feeling I should say :p.

6311959206,"Aci Trezza is a town in Sicily, southern Italy, a frazione of the comune of Aci Castello, c. 10 km north of Catania. Located on the coast of the Ionian Sea, the village has a long history of maritime activity. 

Of the coast of Aci Trezza are three tall, column-shaped islands. According to local legend, these great stones are the ones thrown at Odysseus in The Odyssey. The islands are referred to as the &quot;isole dei ciclopi&quot; (islands of the Cyclops, or Cyclopean Isles) by locals. This compliments the notion that the Cyclops once had a smithy below Mount Etna, which looms over the village to the northwest.

4775864691,"The Reyson Twins weren't hiding anymore, they seemed to have outgrown that little...habit, instead they were very much visual, running, yelling and cajoling with each other and the neighborhood rocks, lining the all too-perfect walkways running the length of State Street.  

This wasn't their usual habitat, but they seemed strangely enough to feel more at ease in unnatural settings such as this.  I watched them from my porch, sitting with my back against the siding and my feet up on the rail, pulling at my 5th of whiskey, every once in a while getting up to take a piss in the flower boxes that hung from the down pipes.

It was an alright day, nothing special, one of those days where the sky was over-cast and had a strange kind of silver to it.

And then it came; roaring like a fiend from some hell, bee-lining straight for the town hall.  This massive screaming fireball, black smoke billowing and waving like a tail.

Like myself, Mrs. Finchess and her baby girl seemed to be the only people who noticed what was happening; even after it hit no one seemed to look up.

Which made me think it was the whiskey playing tricks with my eyes.
When it collided with the Town Hall, there was no booming explosion, just a loud, moist crunch, and the soft distant sound of falling glass.

Jersyside, Placentia, in Placentia Bay.  I spent five or six years in
my early and mid-twenties getting work as an archaeologist 
each summer and scattered other times. I missed that work when 
I got an inside job thirty years ago. And still do. So whenever I get 
a chance, I stop and stare interestedly at digs the way some people 
stare at other people's children.

The other day I got a good tour of this site. The &quot;New Fort&quot; was an
unfinished fort by the English on top of the earlier French Fort
Louis. The fellows in the picture, and the woman coming up in the
rear, are working their buckets of soil through the dig's sifter.
This site is nearly totally waterlogged, being a beach claimed from
the sea 300 years ago, so its sifter is really a washer -- water is
sprayed over the soil in hopes of finding any missed artefacts. It's a
muddy job these people have but the dig is going well.

In the main one that was supposed to be a casino, we found this spider, patiently waiting for the prey.

I left the research lab *much* later than I had planned to today, but decided to take a walk across the high level bridge to catch the train at Grandin, rather than catching it at the University like usual. I was walking hurriedly along and isolated from the world my by music, not really paying as much attention to my surroundings as I usually do. Then, in the midst of my craze, this man caught my attention.

He was standing in the middle of the field overlooking the river, as serene as one can be. In spite of the intense wind and storm clouds brewing overhead, he was slowly and methodically stretching, exercising, or participating in some kind of art form (perhaps T'ai Chi?).

I walked right past him and maintained my speedy gate until he was about 400 meters behind me. Then the sheer ridiculousness of my flustered mental state hit me with full force, and I realized what a perfect scene I was missing out on!

I whipped around, retraced my steps, quietly set all of my bags down, took out my camera, and steadied myself for a few shots of the man. I have no clue why he was there, for how long he was there, what he was doing, or what inspired him to do this in the middle of the windy field with a storm imminent, but I'm sure glad he did it. It was yet another wakeup call that served to remind  me of all of the sensations and experiences I miss when I am stuck in my own little world of programming and music.

It is located west of the city center at the junction of Unter den Linden and Ebertstraße, immediately west of the Pariser Platz. It is the only remaining gate of a series through which Berlin was once entered. One block to the north stands the Reichstag building. The gate is the monumental entry to Unter den Linden, the renowned boulevard of linden trees which formerly led directly to the city palace of the Prussian monarchs. It was commissioned by King Frederick William II of Prussia as a sign of peace and built by Carl Gotthard Langhans from 1788 to 1791. Having suffered considerable damage in World War II, the Brandenburg Gate was fully restored from 2000 to 2002 by the Stiftung Denkmalschutz Berlin (Berlin Monument Conservation Foundation). Today, it is regarded as one of Europe's most famous landmarks.

4346212152,"“It was long after midnight, when we got to unconditional love”
Cold Fire: Rush, Counterparts

The song Cold Fire opens with a burst of chord, followed by the band thundering in, which is how I always viewed the power of the lyrics in the song.  Neil Peart is not known for writing about emotional thoughts and poems of prose… but this song is a striking stab at the subject matter of the passions of love: more so the love in a moment.

I hope everyone has been in that moment where all of your walls come down and melt away- where you encounter someone and your brain- for that moment in time- quits saying “Yes, but…” and you just go with what you feel.  For someone who has had a lot of walls up in their life I can tell you that when that moment has come for me it’s been EXACTLY what this long talks about: Phosphorescent, a flame in a diamond, pushed limits, etc.

This album came out when I was at a period of discovery in my life I guess one could say.  And every time I hear this song I remember that season in my life where every day brought a new adventure and a new memory… and how it makes me want that every day in my life.  How it makes me want that for everyone for every day in their life!

*** Artist Notes ***
I liked the imagery of having the heart and the time all in one hand: almost as if in a single hand we can cast our fate of love, without “other hands” having to sway the mix.

Lyrics:
It was long after midnight 
When we got to unconditional love 
She said sure, my heart is boundless 
But don't push my limits too far 

I said if love was so transcendent 
I don't understand these boundaries 
She said just don't disappoint me --- 
You know how complex women are 
I'll be around 
If you don't let me down 
Too far 

It was just before sunrise 
When we started on traditional roles 
She said sure I'll be your partner 
But don't make too many demands 

I said if love has these conditions 
I don't understand those songs you love 
She said this is not a love song 
This isn't fantasy-land 
I'll be around 
If you don't push me down 
Too far 

DON'T GO TOO FAR --- 
The phosphorescent wave on a tropical sea 
Is a cold fire 
DON'T CROSS THE LINE --- 
The pattern of moonlight on the bedroom floor 
Is a cold fire 
DON'T LET ME DOWN --- 
The flame at the heart of a pawnbroker's diamond 
Is a cold fire 
DON'T BREAK THE SPELL --- 
The look in your eyes as you head for the door 
Is a cold fire 

Love is blind if you are gentle 
Love can turn to a long, cold burn

This park has an interesting history. It's really old, but was recently (ok almost ten years ago now. time seems to fly now) fenced off and regulated due to some parents suing the county because their child got injured. The injury was the kid's fault and the parents weren't there to watch him. This park was free and maintained by the people that used it up until that point. So if we want to skate it without being hassled, we have to sneak in earlier in the day. It sucks being kicked out of a skatepark for skateboarding.

update: here's  a video clip of another guy and another trick: <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHmeEqNFcaY&amp;fmt=22"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHmeEqNFcaY&amp;fmt=22</a>

Kenai Peninsula Borough, Alaska
Accessed via the Seward Highway

Having used the Blue Ridge Parkway for both recreation and even commuting for several years, I was really excited to drive the Seward Highway in Alaska because of its similar scenic and recreational opportunities.  Although very different than the Blue Ridge Parkway--the road is straighter and follows low valleys and river banks versus the curvy and high ridgeline nature of the BRP--it does not lack in the beauty department.  The United States Department of Agriculture has deemed the Seward Highway a Forest Service Scenic Byway; the United States Department of Transportation has named it an &quot;All-American Road&quot;; and the state of Alaska has recognized it as a State Scenic Byway.  We drove the entire distance (much shorter than the BRP at only 127 miles) from Anchorage to Seward, stopping along the way to take in the various sights and attractions along the way (coastal seas, glaciers, wildflowers, wildlife, waterfalls and so on).  The well-known publication, National Geographic, listed the Seward Highway as one of the World's five-hundred most spectacular trips in its book entitled, &quot;Drives of a Lifetime.&quot;  In the book the author quotes:  &quot;If all the billboards along Alaska's Seward Highway were laid end to end, they'd reach—nowhere. There are no billboards here, no tollbooths, few towns, and fewer gas stations. But if you're looking for whales and waterfalls, blue glaciers and sharp-toothed mountains, calm trout ponds and stormy ocean fjords, there's enough visual overload here to fill a hard drive with digital pictures.&quot;  The shot above was roadside just before descending down into the coastal town of Seward, Alaska.

Arctic Lupine is a wildflower I had never seen before in my travels around the Southeastern United States.  I was equally excited to see these for the first time when I visited Alaska as I was to drive the Seward Highway.  About sixteen inches or so in height, these wildflowers were a vivid mixture of blue, purple and white tones that could light up a roadside meadow and create fantastic foreground interest in pretty much any photograph.  If only I had a macro lens I would have made these the star of some of my shots for sure!  Lupine is poisonous for humans to ingest.  An internet source I found actually says that Lupine comes from the Latin word &quot;lupus&quot; (meaning wolf) for Lupine was believed to ruin the soul! "

The Horseshoe II fire roared through the Chiricahua Wilderness in June, 2011.  Much of the wilderness area was devastated by the fire an the floods that came with the 2011 monsoon.  Valiant efforts saved much of the Chiricahua National Monument.  The western 2/3's to 3/4's of CNM was saved by back fires and suppression efforts.  The eastern 1/4 to 1/3 was hit hard but hit spotty.  It always amazes me how a wildland fire can scorch an area with intense heat, but completely spare a couple of acres right next to it.

In the film the falls has a much higher volume.  At the north end of the gorge is a hydroelectric dam that was constructed in 1913, according to the park ranger, the director John Boorman had worked it out with Georgia Power where they would release large volumes of water to add to the intensity of the scenes.  The falls is not the actual falls used in the film when Burt Reynolds, Ned Beatty and John Voigt go over after Ronnie Cox is shot and where Burt Reynolds breaks his leg.

From the Williams News Thursday, September 18, 2008

&quot;Citing ‘green’ reasons, Grand Canyon Railway® opts to shut down popular historic engine

The familiar hooting of the steam engine in Williams is set to become a thing of the past, as officials with Xanterra Parks and Resorts recently announced their plans to eliminate the historic steam engine from The Grand Canyon Railway's fleet. Citing environmental concerns, Xanterra officials plan to keep the steam locomotive as a &quot;living&quot; display, while using diesel locomotives for the actual runs between Williams and the Grand Canyon.

Judi Lages, vice president of sales and marketing for Xanterra Parks and Resorts, said the decision to eliminate the steam engine from regular service is based on a number of factors. According to a Sept. 15 letter, becoming &quot;greener&quot; counted as one of the largest reasons behind the move. Officials hope to save 113,000 gallons of diesel fuel a year by eliminating the steam engine, as well as saving an estimated 151,200 gallons of water. Other environmental concerns associated with the use of the steam engine would also be eliminated, according to the letter, including the use of journal oil, steam oil and bearing oil, as well as over 25 different boiler chemicals. Greenhouse gases and other pollutants are also expected to diminish. Xanterra officials recently hired coordinator Morgan O'Connor to oversee environmental conditions at the Railway's maintenance yard. According to O'Connor, who spoke before the Williams Rotary Club July 15, environmental conditions at the maintenance yard were more &quot;brown&quot; than &quot;green.&quot;

The decision to eliminate steam engine service has met with some opposition; however, as some believe the loss of the engine will cause the Railway to lose its historic appeal. A total of 20 jobs associated with the steam engine were also eliminated as a result of the engine's removal. The steam engine typically ran each year from Memorial Day weekend to Labor Day weekend.

&quot;There were 20 jobs that were affected. Some were part time and some were full time,&quot; Lages said. &quot;Our boss is the National Park Service and it is just not in keeping with our environmental mission to continue to run the steam. We're a very, very green company.&quot;

Lages said Xanterra administrators have received a number of e-mails from individuals opposed to their decision.

&quot;We've received maybe 20 emails from steam enthusiasts and we can understand their disappointment,&quot; Lages said. &quot;We don't think that the majority of our riders are going to see a difference. We don't think it's a going to have an overall effect.&quot;

Other popular attractions, she said, such as the annual ride of the Polar Express, will continue normal operations.

&quot;Polar express is going to continue as it always has,&quot; Lages said. &quot;Our numbers are good this year.&quot;

Steam enthusiast Jeff Stafford called the elimination of the steam engine a &quot;travesty&quot; and said he hoped Xanterra would reconsider their decision.

&quot;Grand Canyon steam engines are some of the cleanest steam engines around and put out less pollution than many diesel engines. In fact, both engines 29 and 4960 were recently overhauled so that they would be more fuel efficient,&quot; Stafford said. &quot;The lost jobs, threats to summer tourism, and negative impacts to the town of Williams cannot be underestimated. Many visitors ride the railway in the summer specifically for the steam experience. Max and Thelma were concerned when they sold the railroad to any new owner that the history would be preserved and jobs would be left untouched. They must be disappointed to hear this news.&quot;

Meanwhile, a formal announcement on the pending sale of the Grand Canyon Railway to Colorado billionaire Phil Anschutz has yet to be announced. Word of the sale first came to light in June of this year and a tentative closing date was set for this month. The sale would mark the second sale of the Grand Canyon Railway in almost as many years. Xanterra Parks and Resorts first bought the company from founding owners Max and Thelma Biegert in early 2007. Anschutz, listed in &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine as the 31st richest person in America, is involved in a number of entertainment ventures. According to Xanterra officials, Anschutz indicated he would retain staff at the management level and continue the company's environmental efforts at the Railway.

Xanterra officials would not comment on the sale and what impacts that sale might have had on the recent removal of the steam engine from regular service.

Life there is simple but requires hard work as the only ressources people have are their hands, their knowledge for farming and a few annimals.

Heute ist die kleine Stadt ein beliebtes Ziel für Touristen und einer der wichtigsten Urlaubsorte der gesamten Provinz. Ausgrabungen, bei denen Gräber aus wahrscheinlich vorrömischer Zeit gefunden wurden, belegen, dass der Mensch hier schon seit langer Zeit ansässig ist. Wegen seiner Lage war Cannobio schon zu römischer Zeit ein wichtiges strategisches und wirtschaftliches Zentrum.

Im frühen Mittelalter gab es hier einen Königshof, später wurde die Stadt Hauptort eines weiten Gebietes, das den Erzbischöfen von Mailand unterstellt war. Im 12. und 13. Jh. war Cannobio eine freie Kommune und blieb es auch bis in das Jahr 1342, dem Jahr der freiwilligen Unterwerfung der Stadt unter die Visconti. Diese Familie herrschte über den Ort, bis er 1441 in die Lehensherrschaft von Vitaliano Borromeo fiel.Aus dieser Zeit sind auch heute noch viele Spuren zu sehen: z.B. die eleganten Paläste aus der Zeit zwischen dem 17. und dem 19. Jh., die zwischen den Kieselsteinhäusern aufragen.

Der Ortskern lag ursprünglich entlang der heutigen Via Giovanola. Von dort aus gelangte man zum Sitz der politischen und religiösen Macht: Von ersterer zeugt noch der Palazzo della Ragione aus dem späten 13. Jh., der heute kurz Parasio genannt wird. Das Gebäude ist gut restauriert und beherbergte im Erdgeschoss das Gericht und im oberen Stockwerk den Rat.

Sometimes I get carried away with trying to line up landscape photographs that showcase my imagined skill.  It's often, however, the cleanest, clearest, and simplist photos that give me the most satisfaction.  Much like writing, if you hide behind lots of technical terms, jargon and concepts, the message is lost in translation.  The best writers and speakers in my personal opinion are always those that can take complicated ideas and translate them into conversational and well flowing verse that is both relatable and easy to understand.  In photography, I think many of my favorite photographers have similar abilities--to generate the feeling of a landscape or moment without over-the-top gimics; to capture and/or enhance natural colors and patterns in ways that translate powerfully; to create photographs with depth that appear as if you could get lost in the scene itself.  I think sometimes instead of going out at the exact right time of day and/or ensuring that my composition has strong, contrasting elements in all the right areas and/or worrying about if others have taken the same photograph--sometimes these things just need to be tucked into a nice tidy box and filed away for another day.  Sometimes I think that I just need to detach the camera from the tripod and remote and all the other goodies I've accumulated over time and just walk around.  I'm not saying that planning is not absolutely critical in landscape photography--knowing the weather conditions, scouting out locations, having the appropriate gear, understanding compositional logic and so forth is critical and will remain so.  But, when it comes time to capture the picture, be it during golden light with bags of gear for a shot that you've planned for three years or in the middle of the afternoon at an impromtu location that caught your eye, the photograph is still about the simple (yet so difficult!) art of translating the emotion of the place--using compositional elements, light, gear, etc.--to capture a feeling that is translated, maybe easily, maybe more subtly, but translated nonetheless, through the elements of your photograph and to your viewer.  Sometimes with so much technical jargon to remember, it is easy for me to lose the bottom-line goal of photography, which in my mind, has little to do with mega-pixels, thirds, and clean frames.  Just some rambling thoughts for Flickr Friday..."

When people arrived at the opening, they were instructed to go out into the courtyard and find the little paint chip bits.  When someone found one, they were instructed to bring it to me.

2083874724,"We often forget that despite all the problems, the world around us is still filled with beautiful, wonderful things. While it’s said that beauty is in the eye of the beholder, it really starts from the mind of the observer and the focus of ones attention. Often we don’t find beauty until it overwhelms us by being so big it’s impossible to miss it - like a great sunset painting the sky orange - simply because beauty’s not what we’re looking for.

But beauty can also be found almost anywhere, anytime - all you have to do is look for it. Just stop and look around carefully - what do you see? It could be as cold as a snowflake, as technical as a reflection off of a glass or steel wall or the glimmering or as simple as seeing the dancing hot air rising from the railroad tracks, distorting the view. It might be a leaf blowing in the wind, could be a simple cloud in the sky or as something as humane as another person’s smile or a look in somebodys eye. If you don’t find anything, look closer. "

Sunwapta Falls is a waterfall of the Sunwapta River located in Jasper National Park, Canada.
It is accessible via a short drive off the Icefields Parkway that connects Jasper and Banff National Parks. The falls have a drop of about 18.5 metres. Sunwapta is a native word that means turbulent water. It is most spectacular in the late spring when the spring melt is at it's peak.
 
The water originates from the Athabasca Glacier, and volumes are higher in early summer, caused by glacial meltdown."

Grundarfjörður is a small town, situated in the north of the Snæfellsnes peninsula in the west of Iceland. The town is situated in front of an impressive mountain range which has a slightly alpine look. On the sea side, there is a beautiful mountain called Kirkjufell which is a diverted piece of the mountain strip Mýrarhyrna. The mountain forms a small peninsula.

The town itself is a charming, quiet, nice fishing village. Another awesome hidden corner in Iceland.

This one was shot at 1.30 a.m., with the sun pointing at North, lighting all the town and the mountains nearby. It was quite cloudy, so, again, a long exposition would spread that fantastic light through the image.

Grundarfjörður es en sí mismo un encantador y tranquilo agradable pueblo pesquero. Otro rincón escondido e increíble de Islandia.

Ésta foto fue hecha a las 1.30h de la madrugada, con el sol apuntando al Norte, iluminando todo el pueblo y las montañas cercanas. Estaba bastante nublado, por lo que, de nuevo, una larga exposición extendería esa fantástica luz a lo largo de la imagen.

2614154293,"Okay, this is my first stranger photo. I found the 100 Strangers group last night and I thought it was a wonderful idea, but also very, very challenging for someone like me.

So after dropping my daughter at Karate lessons today, I drove down Elk Grove Blvd intending to just snap a few photos. I saw this lady and her dog sitting on the sidewalk bench, so I thought she'd a wonderful first subject for this project. 

I parked my car around the corner, filled out my Flickr address on one of my cars and preceded to find the courage to ask her if I could take her photo.

Well, by the time I turned the corner, she and her dog were gone. So I walked about a block down  street and snapped a few photos, but on way back I saw them both walking down the sidewalk coming toward me. I was very nervous.

I raised my camera and she kinda smiled at me. I snapped a photo, and then I asked her if I could take a photo of her and her dog for this project.

I was so nervous and shy. She said okay, but just take a picture of the dog. &quot;I'm from L.A., so I'm used to this,&quot; she said. So I snapped a picture of her dog, but then I said I have to get her in the photo too. She was cool about it. 

I snapped a view photos and gave her my card. But I was so nervous that I didn't even asked her name. So yes indeed this project could definitely help me in shy area.

I mean, I really wanted to ask her snoop down and put her face next to her dog's, but I didn't want to push my luck. It all felt so strange, but I'm really glad I did it.

Oh, and also, I showed her this photo in preview on the camera, which I think is a smart idea. I hope she visits this page and sees it.

One of the most difficult things to convey in any photograph is scale. I have never been near anything as massive as this mountain.

The Ball of Light was in awe as well. I think it was a bit out of breath from the altitude, and was a bit wobbly.

The silence was breathtaking up there. The were occassional rummbles that sounded like a low flying jet, it was both awesome, and quite frightening when I realised it was the sound of rocks and ice tumbling from the distant cliffs! Amazing place.

Took me hours to get used to it when I was their, then had to leave because I was strting ro freeze, and had a masive walk back down.

In a breathtaking way  the &quot;new&quot; water is embedded in the landscape very naturally and offers an environment free of any pollution.
For the tourist the visit of the small villages like Amieira, Alqueva and Estrela directly on the water is a wonderful destination, where a lot of activities can be done: boat trips, sailing, horse riding, swimming, fishing... Visitors wanting to enjoy archaeological and architectonic patrimony can visit Alandroal, Portel, Monsaraz, Juromenha and Terena.
The never-ending nature and old roads are waiting to be discovered by walking, biking, riding or a cross-country car.
With a surface of  250 km2, 
a lakeside of 1.200 km (about 1.000 km on Portuguese  territory, the rest in Spain) 
and a length of about 85 km the  &quot;Barragem de Alqueva&quot; is today the biggest artificial lake in Europe.

Job 12:10 (NIV)


Matthew Henry's Concise Commentary
12:6-11 Job appeals to facts. The most audacious robbers, oppressors, and impious wretches, often prosper. Yet this is not by fortune or chance; the Lord orders these things. Worldly prosperity is of small value in his sight: he has better things for his children. Job resolves all into the absolute proprietorship which God has in all the creatures. He demands from his friends liberty to judge of what they had said; he appeals to any fair judgment.

<b><u>Antelope Canyon (Upper), Page, AZ</u></b>

Upper Antelope Canyon is called Tsé bighánílíní, &quot;the place where water runs through rocks&quot; by the Navajo. It is the most frequently visited by tourists, due to two considerations. First, its entrance and entire length are at ground level, requiring no climbing. Second, beams (shafts of direct sunlight radiating down from openings in the top of the canyon) are much more common in Upper than in Lower. 

<b>The Setup</b>

The way in which photographers are ushered through the upper canyon is really pissy, but the coordination is a well oiled machine if you take the photographers out of the mix. *smile* Basically 6-8 photographers were setup to take this shot - ushered in and then muscled together. Off to the left (out of the shot) our guide threw sand up on top of the rock slab, and then the sand came down like a water fall. The title represents the masterfulness of how they how make the shot setup after so many times of doing this through the course of the last couple years with such precision it's becomes almost comical. 

<b>It's Friday, so I'm checking out for a few days. I hope everyone has a great summer weekend with lots of fun things planned!!!!</b>

<b>Update</b>: I called the MPD media hotline and got a few more facts. During a traffic stop a few blocks away around 7:30, the driver of this late-model Cadillac slowly drove off and hit another car at 13th and Independence. He went another block and drove straight through some security bollards and scaffolding and crashed into the entrance to this USDA building. Police restrained the driver in the car, but then backed away and waited another half an hour before moving in with medics to remove him. He was taken to a hospital, as was the woman driving the car he hit. All the police said about their injuries was that they were not life-threatening.

However, the weather turned out wrong and it was very foggy. As an alternative I took a picture of this lane. The picture isn't post edited, but we took all the stops out of the D7000. The sky was grey, grey and grey. So we had nothing to lose there. The picture we took high lights the sky, but as much, that the trees on the right (in the fog) where still present. Then we turned up the D-lighting and lowered the contrast and the saturation. This is the result. What a beautiful camera... the D7000.

We gingen tijdens de fotografie cursus naar één van de hoogste plekken in de omgeving. Van daaruit heb je prachtige vergezichten met diverse lagen. In de ochtendzon levert dat spectaculaire beelden op. Jammer genoeg niet vandaag, want het was mistig. I.p.v. dat het open trok, werd de bewolking steeds dikker. Als alternatief heb ik toen deze laan geschoten. De foto is niet nabewerkt! Aan de lucht was niets te verliezen, dus die bijt uit. Wel heb ik er voor gezorgd dat de bomen rechtsachter nog net zichtbaar bleven. Om de sfeer optimaal in de foto te krijgen, is D-lighting en contrastverlaging toegepast. Als laatste stap is de verzadiging nog terug gedraaid. Dit kan allemaal gelijktijdig in een D7000, wat is het toch een machtige machine!

Wikipedia:
Culla és un municipi de la Comunitat Valenciana, Espanya. Situat a la província de Castelló i pertanyent a la comarca de l'Alt Maestrazgo.Situada a la Serra de Segures seu clima és continental. La seva orografia es caracteritza per grans desnivells, profunds barrancs i nombroses coves i avencs, la qual cosa proporciona un fort atractiu natural i paisatgístic a la zona.
El clima és mediterrani, però amb contrastos més acusats a causa de la influència de l'element orogràfic. Els hiverns són una mica més freds que a la costa amb el que no és rar veure la neu. Els estius són molt agradables, amb calor durant el dia i fresc per la noche.Remonta seus orígens a èpoques prehistòriques. Prova d'això són les restes arqueològiques trobades al voltant de la Font de la Carrasca i a la Roca del Corb, així com les pintures rupestres del Barranc de Santa Maria i Covarxa o les restes del poblat iber del Castellar.
Fins l'edat mitjana es manca de dades històriques sobre el municipi de Culla, sent incerta l'època de dominació romana. Va ser domini musulmà fins a principis del segle XIII, passant de manera definitiva a mans cristianes en 1233, després de ser reconquerit per D. Blasco de Alagón.
Culla va rebre la carta de poblament el 1244, de mans de Guillem d'Anglesola i la seva dona Constança de Alagón.
El Castell de Culla jugava en aquella època un important paper estratègic per la seva situació i per ampli del seu territori. Al segle XIII va ser castellà del mateix Arnau de Monsonís.
En 1303, Guillem d'Anglesola, nét de Blasco d'Alagó, ven Culla i tots els seus dominis a l'Orde del Temple per la quantitat de 500.000 sous. El 1307 és extingida aquesta Ordre per manament Papal, passant a dependre des de 1317 de l'Ordre de Santa Maria de Montesa. Sent Tinença de l'Ordre de Montesa va passar al seu titular Bernat de Monsonís, que era Comendador Major de l'Ordre de Montesa i Comendador d'Ares i Peñíscolay per herència la baylía de Culla passarà a la família de Català de Monsonís, propietaris de la Casa del Comendador qui van tenir la baylía durant generacions fins al segle XVIII.
És de destacar en aquesta època el naixement de la Setena de Culla o &quot;Comunitat d'herbatge&quot; que estava constituïda per Culla, Benassal, Vistabella del Maestrat, Atzeneta, Benafigos, Vilar de Canes i la Torre d'En Besora. Aquesta agrupació de municipis va comprar els drets d'explotació dels recursos pecuaris i forestals a l'Ordre de Montesa, per així defensar amb més força els seus interessos ramaders comuns. El funcionament de la Setena de Culla va perdurar fins a meitat del segle XIX.
Al segle XVIII es produeix una forta transformació urbanística a Culla, amb la construcció de l'Església, l'ermita de Sant Cristòfol, acompanyat d'altres obres de millora i ampliació del nucli urbà.

5831464083,"I MUST down to the seas again, to the lonely sea and the sky, 
And all I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by, 
And the wheel's kick and the wind's song and the white sail's shaking, 
And a grey mist on the sea's face and a grey dawn breaking. 
  
I must down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide
Is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied; 
And all I ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying, 
And the flung spray and the blown spume, and the sea-gulls crying. 
  
I must down to the seas again to the vagrant gypsy life. 
To the gull's way and the whale's way where the wind's like a whetted knife;
And all I ask is a merry yarn from a laughing fellow-rover, 
And quiet sleep and a sweet dream when the long trick's over.

3045329354,"The Honanki Ruins are a well-preserved Sinagua community.  This is west of Sedona on Lincoln Canyon Road.  The Pink Jeep Tours run this place.  Early settlers in the mid to late 1800's removed the wood that formed the roofs and these started to deteriorate.  

<a href=""http://www.fs.fed.us/r3/coconino/recreation/red_rock/honanki-ruins.shtml"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">www.fs.fed.us/r3/coconino/recreation/red_rock/honanki-rui...</a>
The Honanki Heritage Site cliff dwelling and rock art site is located near the town of Sedona in north-central Arizona. Currently managed by the U.S. Forest Service under the Red Rock Pass Program, the site is open to the general public for visits seven days a week (closed Thanksgiving and Christmas) from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Please call the Red Rock Ranger District at (928) 282-4119 or Palatki at (928) 282-3854 before you go.

The Sinagua, ancestors of the Hopi, lived here from about AD1100 to 1300 preparing meals, raising their families, and making tools from stone, leather, and wood. Nearby they hunted for deer and rabbit, tended various crops, and gathered edible wild plants.

To Honanki Heritage Site From Sedona: Take 89A south from the &quot;Y&quot; (away from OakCreek Canyon). About 1/2 mile south of Milemarker 365, at a group of mailboxes, turn right onto a dirt road (Forest Road 525; passable for passenger cars when dry), and drive 10.2 miles to Honanki Heritage Site and the parking lot.

Alternatively, those with high-clearance vehicles and/or a sense of adventue can turn right on Dry Creek Road off 89A (south of the &quot;Y&quot;, still in the town of Sedona) and follow the signs for Enchantment Resort/Loy Butte. At the road to the Enchantment Resort, turn left onto Boynton Pass Road (FR 152C), and follow the signs for Loy Butte/Palatki (FR 525 to FR 795, pass FR 795 and continue up 525 2.5 miles to Honanki). This road is generally passable to passenger cars when dry, but it is not regularly maintained by the County and has some rough and rocky stretches. The compensation for abusing your motor vehicle are wonderful views of the red rock formations that Sedona is so famous for. 

GPS: N34° 56' 19.032&quot;, W-111° 55' 59.9874&quot;

Fees: A Red Rock Pass (or equivalent) is required on all vehicles parked at our Cultural Sites. This pass can be purchased at these sites during normal hours of operation.

NOTES:

The only facilities at Honanki are Vault-type Toilets. No drinking water available. 
Pets are not allowed on the grounds of our Heritage Sites.

Wikipedia:
Miravet és una vila i municipi de la comarca de la Ribera d'Ebre.Se situa a la riba dreta de l'Ebre, a la depressió de la cubeta de Móra, tancada en la seva part meridional pel congost de Miravet o Pas de Barrufemes, al límit amb el Baix Ebre. La part nord té els contraforts de la serra de Cavalls. La vila està situada a la dreta del riu, al peu d'un turó d'uns 100 metres d'alçada on s'alça el castell de Miravet.Al nord-est hi ha un barri conegut com &quot;Raval dels Canterers&quot;.El poble es compon de dues parts ben diferents: les cases del nucli antic s'enfilen des del riu per la paret rocosa de la muntanya, a recer del castell. Aquí es troba un antic embarcador, el molí medieval, els porxos, l'antiga aljama morisca-jueva, el carrer de la jueria, les muralles de tancament i talaia i l'església Vella, antiga església parroquial, d'arquitectura renaixentista del segle XVII (construïda per l'orde de l'Hospital damunt de l'anterior mesquita musulmana), que conté exposicions relacionades amb la història del poble i està oberta en èpoques turístiques o per exposicions temporals.Al davant de l'església hi ha la plaça-mirador de la Sanaqueta, amb vistes al riu. Hi ha una sèrie de cases penjades i terrasses enjardinades, fins al penya-segat del castell. Al peu del cingle rocós hi ha una bifurcació cap a la típica Costa de Riago, un camí costerut i empedrat que baixa fins al riu i continua per la vora fins a l'antic molí àrab, i un altre que s'endinsa per les restes arqueològiques al darrere del castell i continua seguint la ruta senyalitzada de Les Blores.
El nucli urbà modern es troba al llarg de la plana esquerra del Galatxo, un antic canal natural del riu (del que els terrissaires treien l'argila). En aquesta part s'hi troba la casa de la vila, la part comercial i de serveis, i les zones esportives, escoles, i tallers. Un camí asfaltat puja fins al castell, on es pot aparcar.

ESP:
Miravet es un municipio de Cataluña, España. Perteneciente a la provincia de Tarragona, en la comarca de Ribera de Ebro, situado al sur de ésta, a la derecha del río Ebro, y en el límite con las de Bajo Ebro y la Tierra Alta. Destaca el castillo templario de Miravet, situado sobre la colina que domina el río.Castillo: Monumento declarado B.I.C., propiedad de la Generalitat de Catalunya (uno de sus más visitados).
Antigua fortaleza islámica convertida por la orden del Temple en castillo-convento a mediados del s. XII. De obra románica cisterciense y espíritu cruzado está considerado uno de los mejores ejemplos la arquitectura religiosa y militar de la orden del Temple en todo Occidente, junto con el de Peñíscola.
El Castillo de Miravet es de origen andalusí (Puede observarse aportaciones musulmanas de los periodos taifa y almorábide) que fue transformada y ampliada por los caballeros templarios. Éstos lo reformaron creando un castillo convento (siglo XII). Es una mezcla de estilos islámico, bizantino y cisterciense. El estilo del castillo corresponde al románico tardío y al gótico de transición. Dispone de salas para la autosuficiencia del castillo: almacén, bodega, cocina, iglesia...
Actualmente está en proceso de restauración dado que estuvo afectado por diferentes guerras como las Guerras Carlistas y en la Guerra Civil española (1936-39). Su ubicación era muy buena ya que el pueblo de Miravet se encuentra en un meandro del río Ebro.
Paso de Barca: Ultimo transbordador original de todo el Ebro que aún funciona sin motor, cruzando el río tan sólo con la corriente del agua y la maestría del barquero.
Pueblo Antiguo: El Pueblo antiguo de Miravet, Cap de la Vila, al pie del castillo y adaptado a la roca sobre el río Ebro, merece toda nuestra atención. En otro tiempo constituyó la rápita o centro urbano de la alquería musulmana de Miravet, desde sus orígenes -s. VIII-hasta la expulsión de su población en el siglo XVII.
Destaca a simple vista por su estampa panorámica, el tipismo de sus calles estrechas y porchadas, la última atarazana fluvial donde calafateaban los llaguts (s. XI), el molino de aceite y barníz alfarero, la sede de la aljama morisca y su arcada mudèjar, la iglesia &quot;vieja&quot; renacentista de la orden del Hospital y el mirador de la Sanaqueta así como las ruinas de las casas destruidas a causa de la Batalla del Ebro, la calle del Banco y la de las Ferreries.
Es de especial atención su enclave y la verticalidad de la roca roja sobre la que se asienta el castillo, así como la ruta de les Blores, recorrido desde la calzada empedrada del acceso sur (Costa de Riago) hasta los restos arqueológicos del primer poblado bereber, al pie del castillo, desde donde, además, se dominan unas vitas increibles sobre el Ebro, el meandro del Tamarigar, el frondoso bosque de ribera y las formaciones dolomíticas por las que pasa"

Süre was pleased for me to photograph her but before I'd finished a mother and teenage boy turned up. The boy's hands were covered in bad warts and they had come to Süre for a cure. Together we all clambered into Süre's tiny ramshackle home where she fished out a handful of dried grapes, instructing the boy to dress his hand with them. They paid her with some home-grown tomatoes. I took this photo after her consultation. You can catch a glimpse of the tomatoes on the step behind her.

Svartifoss (Black Fall) is the name of this waterfall in Skaftafell National Park in Iceland, and is one of the most popular sights in the park. It is surrounded by dark lava columns, which give rise to its name. The hexagonal columns were formed inside a lava flow which cooled extremely slowly, giving rise to crystallization.

The base of this waterfall is noteworthy for its sharp rocks. New hexagonal column sections break off faster than the falling water wears down the edges.

It was a cloudy-cloudy day, so why not shoot on B&amp;W, anyway it was the shape of the rocks and the moving water what interested to my eye. I thought a long exposition would work for the image, the bright water, the dark stones....

Miss my b&amp;w film camera loaded with an ISO 400 film, with its grain, its contrast....

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Svartifoss (Cascada Negra) es el nombre de esta cascada en Parque Nacional de Skaftafell (Islandia), y es una sus atracciones  más populares. Está rodeada por columnas de lava  oscura, que dan origen a su nombre. Las columnas, de forma hexagonal, se formaron dentro de una erupcion de lava que se enfrió muy lentamente, mediante cristalización.

La base de la cascada destaca por sus rocas afiladas, cuyas secciones hexagonales son erosionadas en los bordes constantemente por el agua que cae.

Era un día nublado, muy nublado, ¿por qué no disparar en blanco y negro?. De todos modos  lo único que me interesaba era el contraste de la forma de las rocas y el agua en movimiento. Una larga exposición me daría esta imagen, el agua clara, la piedras oscuras ....

En ese momento eché de menos mi cámara de película cargada con una película de ISO400, con sus matices, su contraste, su grano ....

______________________________
Jjajaj, esta foto es algo contradictoria porque yo no soy así EN ABSOLUTO. Vieron que dicen que las mujeres HABLAN todo el tiempo? Que para comprar ropa tardan AÑOS? Que son MUY chusmas? Que les interesa TODO lo que le pasa a la gente? Que pueden pasar HORAS hablando por teléfono? Bueno. Eso no tiene nada que ver conmigo. Creo que por eso cuando era chiquita todos mis amigos eran varones. Cuando fui creciendo fui empezando a tolerar a las mujeres 'tipo'. Aunque todavía no consigo muy bien tolerar a las que hablan por demás, y a las que tardan horas en comprar ropa. Es decir, yo voy veo, si me gusta lo llevo si no, NO. No es TANTO drama. Y con respecto a lo de hablar.. quizás yo soy el otro extremo, pero no soporto cuando me hablan mucho! Por ejemplo, estoy tratando de escuchar música, y tengo una radio-parlate al lado mío secandome la mente TODO EL TIEMPO. Contandome TODO TIPO de cosas, algunas interesantes, otras no (nunca sabremos cuales son las interesantes ya que sus palabras entran por un oído y salen por el otro). No lo tolero mucho que digamos. No se no se, quizás yo soy muy aburrida, que se yo. Pero no se piensen que cuando alguien me quiere contar cosas que le pasaron, que se yo, tiene un drama algo así, yo no escucho. Obvio que escucho, ahora, venirme a contar pelotudeces no! Es que, yo creo que el oído tiene que descansar un rato, no? No se, lo único que se es que yo soy así, nací para cantar (callar) y ser feliz.

Salton City Beach and Westmorland.
I cant remember exactly where this is precisely except that it is in what is left of what never was Salton City; a ghost city which appears on google maps but is in fact not there save for graded gravel driveways which would have been streets and skeletal framework of telephone poles which hold aloft wires that are functionless and power or communicate nothing. 
There is a section if the city which was once populated by trailer homes and has since been eviscerated by weather and salt from the dying lake on which the city is named. Being there, the places is eerily silent and is reminiscent of of the opening scenes in Robert Wise's film depiction of Micheal Chrichton's 'The Andromeda Strain' where a small town is wiped out by an alien contaminant.

<b>Buffalo Central Terminal, Buffalo, NY</b>

<b>About ...</b>
After waking from my short mental slumber after a 5K run today, I wandered out with a couple new toys in hand. This is the first proving ground for any new equipment i purchase (or borrow). Buffalo Central Terminal is an icon of the abandonment world in the North East. Just like Trotting Park (of the last 5 photos), this is probably the second most iconic and recognizable buildings in the urban photography world. I'm lucky enough to have it in my back yard, and a LONG way off from being reused for anything other than the occasional wine/beer festival. CSX controls the extensions, while a preservation incorporation (?) controls the main concourse and terminal (thank God). 

After I was done playing, I started to wander back and sure enough that 1 out of 100 chances of a sitting train (without cargo) was on my exit route. I didn't panic, but boy was I pissed. I waited for over 45m for the train's conductor to make inspections of his train engine, before I could make my exit and move on with my life. Well, sure enough he finally did, but not without forcing me to wander the extension for a little more gritty shot taking, while I waited. Not happy about it (because I was hungry and had to take a big fat #2 - no toilet paper with me, unusual for road trips for people that know me). 

So, not to exciting, but back from the fringes and heading out to do a little friendly birthday party fun with some friends! "

Hi again, everyone! Hope your weekend is off to a wonderful start… :)

I was just looking back at my oh-so-short photostream, and my monitor nearly exploded from all the color. So I decided to go black-and-white with this one. I shot this just a few hours before my previous post (<a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/landescapephotography/6479313799"">www.flickr.com/photos/landescapephotography/6479313799</a>) at one of the other Kearsarge Lakes. 

So, when I created this flickr account about a month ago, my justification was twofold: 
(1) to share my photography with the world, and 
(2) to learn from the world how I can improve it. 
This post is about both. Personally, I really like this shot, but...well, I feel like it’s missing something. I’ve stared at the image for hours and can’t pinpoint it. Maybe I just prefer my images in color, but I dunno - it doesn’t ‘pop’ for me like some of the others below. I’ve tried lots of things, from different exposure blending to burning and dodging, but I feel like it’s missing one little thing that’ll give it the final push.

Any thoughts/ideas? Or am I just being a huge self-critic?

Thanks for taking the time out of your busy day to stop by!

:)

&quot;... Il y a devant nous une source et un petit étang. Quand aucun vent ne souffle, la surface de l'étang est lisse comme un miroir. Il y a très, très longtemps, le baobab était auprès de l'eau et dressait sa cime vers le ciel.

Il voyait les autres arbres qui avaient des chevelures fleuries, de tendres écorces et des feuilles. Tous étincelaient de couleur et le baobab voyait tout cela dans le miroir et il était malheureux. Ses feuilles à lui étaient minuscules, ses fleurs imperceptibles. Il était gras et son écorce ressemblait à la peau ridée d'un vieil éléphant. L'arbre invoqua Dieu et se plaignit à lui.

Dieu avait créé l'arbre et était satisfait de son œuvre qui n'était pas semblable aux autres. Il aimait la diversité. Seulement, il ne pouvait supporter la critique. Il demanda à l'arbre s'il trouvait beau l'hippopotame ou agréable le cri de l'hyène. Puis Dieu se retira dans les nuages. Il voulait qu'on le laissât réfléchir en paix. La création d'hommes qui lui plairait lui causait déjà bien du souci.... Le baobab ne cessait, ni de se regarder dans le miroir, ni d'élever vers lui ses plaintes. Dieu descendit donc, saisit le baobab, le souleva et le replanta dans la terre les racines vers le ciel. Ainsi l'arbre ne se voyait plus et ne se plaignait plus. Tout était rentré dans l'ordre...&quot;

Every so often I go back through my 'archives' and try to apply some of the new tricks and skills I have gained to some older shots. Here is an example of a photo I took in June 2007 with a Samsung Digimax A6 (an extrememly low rent point and shoot). I even uploaded the original  <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/pixog/3923868578/in/photostream/"">here</a>.

In order to re-adjust this image I took it into Lightroom to adjust the levels, then into Photoshop to remove the unwanted people on the left side. I still wasn't happy though, so I created +1 and -1 exposure equivalent photos and created a 'faux' HDR in Photomatix. Simply using the preset 'painterly' effect and then some final adjustments in Lightroom I got the look I wanted.

For those interested, this is the &quot;Die Macht zu Lande&quot; fountain created by Edmund von Hellmer in 1897. "

The river also has a very healthy population of crocodiles, we seen a few that were at least 12 feet long, and countless smaller ones. I believe this one was about 10 feet long, and did not seem to have any fear of humans.

Everything was fine until one of the guides put a skinned chicken on a long stick, and held it over the side of the boat. This crocodile went nuts right beside the boat ( and about two feet away from my girlfriend ) It was bobbing out of the water trying to get some food while the guide was playing “you can’t jump this high” with the croc……so the girlfriend freaks out a little bit, and goes flying past me to the center of the boat…..perfect, an open seat closer to the action. So, I slid over, and managed to get some good close-up photos, with my 9-18 mm lens. Maybe I was caught up in the moment, but honestly, I did not have any fear, and did not realize how close I was to real danger, until I heard her say….” Get the hell away from the side of the boat, with that wallet in your pocket”

I know, it is the same thing she said, when I was leaning over the edge of a cliff in another photo in Lake Superior Provincial Park. 

Obviously I couldn't picture how he'd done that. Specially the ones that have birds on the top of it all.
So, just a few days before my birthday I received a DVD (oooh, my first birthday present received through mail from flickr hehe)
proving it is all true, and that he doesn't use glue :P

My mom and brother watched it with me and even watching it, they weren't believing. My mother said that she'd believe only if a rock falls.
Two minutes later a rock fell :P hehehe

She even took the dvd to her friends' houses. They were all amazed. Some of my friends watched it too... and we tried to balance some rocks... we obviously failed miserably.

1. I love drama in life and over-react for most things 
2. Colorful and full of plans (most of which seldom get executed)
3. I love coming home at the end of the day 
4. Love framing things around me and hence the need for photography
5. I (still) love watching the nth reruns of Friends and love 'Big Bang Theory' and 'How i met your mother'
6. I love carrot cake and caramel pudding
7. I like sweeping landscapes and when on holiday tirelessly get out of bed in the wee hours to catch the sunrise
8. I am tactless for most part
9. I love food which is dressed up well
10. I am a little too over possessive about my little red dinky toy car
11. I like the way traveling rearranges my priorities in life, every once in a while
12. I love the open road
13. I hate carrying a tripod around, even though its very handy
14. I have no new year resolutions
15. i feel am on the way to becoming a fossil soon!
16. Every time i sit to make these lists, after a point i really begin to start judging myself

Now for the 16 i am tagging, Sneha, Navreet, Nihit Goyal, Gauri Bharat, Amarjeet Singh, Flickrascal (Aneesh), Paavani, Mahesh Gramprohit, Harshuu, Oreofuzzcat (John), Pyngodan, Vinay, Prateek Sharma, Aks (Akshay), Manav Gupta, Shuuro, Kunal. I think its a great way to know you all a wee bit better!

What a week so far! As you might know, 
I'm unemployed for almost three weeks 
now. In the last days, I've been searching 
for a job, sending resumes to several 
schools and formation companies, going 
to interviews, preparing the photographic
meeting to be held next Saturday in 
Santarem and getting ready to start a 
master degree. And if that's not enough,
C was feeling very bad in he last week
with lots of muscular pains and loosing
strength. All is better now with her.
So, thank you all who keep comming
here everyday searching for new photos.
I promise you that everything will be
back to normal very soon. 

...........................

Que semana! Como devem saber, estou
desempregado há cerca de três semanas.
Nos últimos dias, tenho estado à procura 
de emprego, a enviar currículos para
escolas e para empresas de formação,
a preparar o encontro fotográfico do
próximo Sábado em Santarém e a 
preparar-me para iniciar um Mestrado.
E se isso não é suficiente, a C tem-se
sentido muito mal desde a última semana
com muitas dores musculares e 
perdendo alguma força. Felizmente, ela
está um pouco melhor.
Assim, obrigado a todos os que 
continuaram a vir aqui diariamente à 
procura de novas fotos. Prometo que 
tudo voltará ao normal muito em breve.

<b>Marvão - Portugal</b>

Desde hace siglos, Marvão lleva como sobrenombre 'El nido de las águilas'. No es de extrañar: la villa fue levantada a más de ochocientos metros de altura sobre una de las cumbres de la sierra de São Mamede, a seis kilómetros escasos de la frontera con España. Una inexpugnable montaña de granito la separa de los valles y las dehesas. Para llegar a ella es necesario trepar por fatigosas curvas que nacen a sus pies. Una vez arriba, el sacrificio habrá valido la pena. La villa de Marvão es medieval, blanca como la nieve, empedrada e irregular, tortuosa y empinada, protegida por una gruesa línea de murallas oscuras en cuyas esquinas se abren baluartes, matacanes y garitas. Las casas intramuros están decoradas por balcones de hierro forjado, chimeneas alentejanas y pintorescas ventanas manuelinas, bien pertrechadas para los días del frío del invierno. Marvão la fundaron los árabes. Hay quien opina que la mandó crear un caudillo sarraceno de nombre Marvan, allá por el año 770. En árabe, Marvan significa suave, ameno y agradable. La Historia no pudo hallar mejor eufemismo para nombrar tan hermoso pueblo. Sea como fuere, en 1160, don Afonso Henriques conquistó la villa para los escudos cristianos. Más de un siglo después, en 1299, don Dinis mandó erigir su altivo castillo.

<b>Contra las tropas castellanas</b> 

Durante demasiado tiempo, Marvão debió lidiar con el incómodo papel de ser lugar de frontera. Su plaza fuerte defendió los límites más septentrionales del Alentejo. Hubo épocas en que fue palco de lucha contra las tropas de Castilla; hay crónicas que aseguran que durante largos años la población se mantuvo en vigilia y permanente desasosiego a fin de repudiar los ataques castellanos. En reconocimiento de su fidelidad, los Reyes portugueses adornaron su escudo de armas con el lema 'Muy noble y siempre leal villa de Marvão'. A la entrada del pueblo, fuera de las murallas, se alza el convento gótico de Nossa Senhora da Estrela. Una calleja sinuosa trepa hasta la Praça do Pelourinho, presidida por una picota dieciochesca, una labrada columna desde la que en otro tiempo se leían edictos y se ajusticiaba a reos y malhechores. Sobre la plaza se levantan los antiguos Paços do Concelho, la Priçao y la Torre do Relógio, que aún hoy marca el ritmo cotidiano de la villa. La calle del Espírito Santo sube en dirección al castillo, dejando a un lado la iglesia de Santa María. El templo empezó a edificarse a últimos del siglo XIII y mantuvo obras hasta bien entrado el XVII. Su interior desacralizado acoge hoy el Museo Municipal, rico en piedras megalíticas, útiles prehistóricos, enseres romanos y piezas cartográficas de la villa y la comarca. El largo de Santa María conduce hasta hermosos jardines que corren por todo el perímetro de las murallas hasta la iglesia de Santiago, un templo del siglo XV con una luminosa fachada y puerta de estilo gótico. Pero lo más sobrecogedor aguarda arriba, en la cúspide del espolón rocoso.

El castillo de Marvão fue uno de los más importantes emplazamientos defensivos al Sur del Tajo. Declarado monumento nacional, sus fuertes defensas se confunden con la roca granítica del monte. Sus patrocinadores trataron de erigir un castillo inexpugnable. Por los lados Norte, Sur y Oeste es imposible el acceso. Las murallas se yerguen sobre paredes verticales que imposibilitan el ascenso. Sólo por el lado Este que mira a España era posible un ataque. Por eso los ingenieros de la época proyectaron hasta tres recintos que frenaran el hostigamiento enemigo. La torre del homenaje es una atalaya cúbica de considerable altura que sufrió serios daños en el terremoto de Lisboa, allá en 1755. Desde su azotea se advierte una de las vistas más hermosas del país. Al Este, España; al Sur y al Oeste, la sierra de São Mamede, y al Norte, Castelo Branco y las estribaciones de la Serra da Estrela.


<b>Garitas, baluartes y precipicios</b> 

En uno de los recintos de la fortaleza hay una cisterna cuyo fondo está iluminado por la luz natural, gracias a tres claraboyas abiertas en la bóveda. La cisterna tiene unas dimensiones colosales. Los alcaides de la fortaleza mandaron construirla para garantizar el suministro de agua durante seis largos meses. Un paseo por el camino de ronda permite contemplar la vasta magnitud del castillo. A cada paso se abren garitas abovedadas y baluartes sostenidos como por un milagro sobre los terribles precipicios. A los pies de Marvão, los caminos se multiplican rumbo a los parajes más idílicos de São Mamede. Camino a Castelo de Vide hay una hilera de árboles centenarios, ordenados en línea recta, que se extienden a lo largo de doscientos y pico metros. A la salida de su sombra la sierra regala dehesas y lomas verdeadas por encinas y alcornoques. Al contrario de lo que pudiera pensarse, São Mamede es un paraje poblado por el hombre desde tiempo inmemorial. A cada paso se repiten las indicaciones de los conjuntos megalíticos que hicieron de este rincón de la geografía portuguesa uno de los lugares más pretéritos para su historia."

Ruidoso, NM - Their dreams of living life floating through the clouds have now grounded them in a nightmare. A fiery crash in front of a crowd of on-lookers was only the beginning . Now, a pilot husband is praying his wing-walking wife will survive.

Kyle and Amanda Franklin travel the world performing high-flying stunts from their plane, but this time was different. Now the rest of their lives will never be the same.

10 Image Photomerge

This is up there as one of the coolest things I've ever experienced.  We woke up late that morning and turned on The Weather Channel to discover that thunderstorms were moving in from Tennessee, so we opted to head to Mt. Mitchell, the highest peak east of the Mississippi which was about 40 miles away, to photograph the incoming storm front.  At about twenty miles we were passing across a peak we noticed the storm front was nearly on top of us so I decided to pour on the speed.  As we came around the mountain we could see that there was not going to be any way for us to make it to Mitchell, so at the suggestion of my friend Nigel we stopped by the Craggy Mountain overlook.  There were several people gathered around photographing the oncoming storm and many just staring in amazement.  We hopped out of the car and I was able to shoot two panoramics when I stopped and realized this storm was moving at an extremely quick pace. Within a 1/2 a minute the storm had moved up the mountain and with a huge gust of wind and rain blasted past everyone and we beelined for the car.  As we waited in the car, gust after gust was pushed the body of the car. Outside the windows, even with the wipers going, the clouds had enshrouded everything and driving rain pelted the car making visibility to just across the sidewalk from the car.  The good thing was, if we had of made it to Mt. Mitchell, we would have been completely exposed to the elements with out any shelter to protect ourselves, so the timing of the approach of the storm actually turned out perfectly.

6782736835,"Houten is a so called &quot;Vinex&quot; community. These villages got an extra assignment of the government to build a lot of houses, to combat the housing shortage in The Netherlands. So the very small village has become in about 30 years a  village/town of about 50000 inhabitants. The original village is now a district called &quot;Het Oude Dorp&quot; (The old village).

Although hardly mentioned in history books, Houten has a rich history. There are graves found going back to the 7-th century. Building one of the new districts of Houten (see the Fishermans houses in my stream) remnants of Roman villa's were discovered. Even materials from the Iron Age were found.

Going to Het Oude Dorp you will be aware of the fact that you have to &quot;climb&quot; a little bit. Houten is build on a mound (very unusual in this part of The Netherlands). Now-a-days most of the rivers in Holland have dikes to control the varying amount of water. In early days the land around the rivers flooded (given the rich soil, river clay). Houten was one of the parts that didn't flood, because it was lifted a tiny little bit above the surrounding.

Here you see &quot;Het Plein&quot; looking to the east. In the back ground the RK church is high lighted.

Morella y su castillo se divisan desde la lejanía, y recuerdan las fortalezas que se describen en los cuentos. En su interior encontramos el convento de Sant Francesc del siglo XII en el que encontramos unas escaleras circulares (que conducen al claustro) las cuales representan los círculos concéntricos que se originan al arrojar una piedra al agua.  Esta disposición de las escaleras  es una evocación de la muerte, nos recuerda el hundimiento del ser humano en las aguas de la muerte. De igual significado son las pinturas medievales que se descubrieron en el refectorio del convento, las cuales representan la Danza de la muerte, un tema muy extendido durante el medioevo después de la Peste Negra que asoló la Europa del siglo XIV, que simboliza la idéa de que en la muerte todas las personas se hacen iguales, a pesar del disgusto de los ricos.

It’s usually studio photography and probably not how I want to photograph in the future, but this is an enormous opportunity to learn from people who are generous enough to let me watch them work, ask them questions and even take pictures. As for the pictures themselves – I’m sticking to my guns, trying to catch people when they least expect it and don’t pose – or at least, not for me.

Pigeon Point Lighthouse was built in 1871 to guide ships on the Pacific coast of California. It is the tallest lighthouse (tied with Point Arena Light) on the West Coast of the United States. It is still an active Coast Guard aid to navigation. Pigeon Point Light Station is located on the coastal highway (State Route 1), 5 miles (8 km) south of Pescadero, California. The 115-foot (35 m), white masonry tower, resembles the typical New England structure. Because of its location and ready access from the main highway, Pigeon Point entertains a large number of public visitors.

The lighthouse and the land around have been preserved as Pigeon Point Light Station State Historic Park, a California state park. It is between Santa Cruz and San Francisco and is one of the most picturesque lighthouses on the Pacific coast.

The light passing through the window is split into different beams travelling at different speeds, resulting in interference. The inferference colours can be very interesting for the photographer. 

Most often these patterns are rather faint, but if the incident light is already partially polarized, the colour effects can be easily detected without a polarising filter. If a polarising filter is used, these effects can be rather stunning.</i>

It didn't really stand out and was quite missable, mostly because of its small size. As I passed it, it caught the corner of my eye and I turned back to have a closer look. I was quite pleased with this find.

Grateful for my life in the West! 

Out west we have &quot;land, lots of land&quot; and a lot of it is uninhabitable for lack of water, and because there's no water, the landscape is simple and straight forward. I live along the Wasatch Front in Utah where Mount Timpanogos reaches 11,749 feet in elevation...so we have mountains, but I travel south to places like Moab, Blanding, and Kanab where the landscape is horizontal for the most part and where blue sky meets red sandstone in the most beautiful contrasting way.

I've lived in the west all of my life and I've been blessed to see a lot of it. This fence is near Hornitos, California...a ghost town founded by Mexicans during the gold rush days. In a matter of days, my husband will move to Texas and I'll join him in nine months...so...I'll be off to wander a different part of the planet before I know it and grand adventures await I'm sure!

After the nuclear reactors criticality in 1983, the Soviet Army disassembled them in 1989, and after the Estonian independence in 1991, and July 30 1994 was made a deal to transfer the military structures away from the Estonian country, with a deadline in September 30 1995.

The main faced by the Estonian authorities was that they have no nuclear expert to dismantle the military base and so they had to institute a task force to work on it, in May 1994 the Paldiski International Expert Reference Group (PIERG) was born.

The team work for ten years to dismantle useless bases and make in safety the contaminated areas, nowadays the work is not finish and they are working on a new sarcophagus for the nuclear reactors.

Such as the team is still working to make the area safe, you can find all over the Paldiski area abandoned military bases and buildings that remember you a recent past.

Since I started working full time, I barely
manage to edit and post photos. Anyway,
thank you for your patience and daily visits. 
Since last week, the number of visitors 
grow like I never thought it was possible. 
I must be doing something right.   ;-)

Yesterday, I went to Parque das Nações
(Lisbon) for a relaxant walk with my wife,
when I spotted this shopping cart in the
Tagus river. I was looking for a similar
situation for a long time and I guess I
finally found it.

...................................

Desde que comecei a trabalhar a tempo 
inteiro que raramente tenho tempo para 
editar fotos e colocá-las aqui. De qualquer 
forma, obrigado pela vossa paciência e
visitas diárias. Desde a semana passada
que o número de visitantes cresceu como
eu nunca imaginava. Devo estar a fazer 
algo certo.   ;-)

Ontem, fui ao parque das Nações para um
passeio calmo com a minha mulher, quando
reparei neste carrinho de compras no Rio
Tejo. Há muito tempo que esperava 
encontrar uma situação destas e parece 
que a encontrei finalmente."

I typically dislike editing photos so that they look unrealistic or surreal. But, here in Washington State, the weather tends to make everything gray- and gray is depressing. So, I had to do something that would change it up. I actually don't know if I like the way it came out... but I can't figure out what I should do with it.

You have to let me know what you think of it. No really, tell me if you like it or just straight up hate it. And then tell me why.

We saw at least three rainbows over the town; just as we were giving up the clouds moved on and the sun came out to cast everything in these gorgeous yellow tones. 

<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Centralia,_Pennsylvania"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">Centralia</a> is the site of a mine fire that's been burning since at at least the late 1960s. There are only a handful of residents left, and most of the houses have been torn down, leaving a street grid that's been taken over by a surprisingly lush grassland. If you've ever thought of going there to poke around, do it soon, because the fire has shifted since I was there <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/erin_m/sets/72157605702949527/"">last year</a>, and it will soon become much more difficult to explore. It's now strongest directly underneath the only road left on which you can drive.

<b>***Attention: Geek Speak Below***</b>

Some of you were wanting a more detailed explanation of my High Speed setup and the timing circuit I use.  For most of the high speed photos I have posted I rely on the fast burst of light from the flashes to freeze the action, not the shutter speed.  That is why it is always done in a dark room.  The shutter is open for 1/4-1/3 second, which in high speed photography is quite a long time.

I trigger the shutter with a corded remote, this is done because the amount of time it takes for the shutter to open is longer than it takes for the BB to hit it’s target.  So I open the shutter and then fire the BB gun.  This is where the timer circuit comes in.  I use the <a href=""http://www.cameraaxe.com/wiki/index.php?title=Main_Page"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">Camera Axe</a> timing device.  It can be purchased as a kit and assembled at home.  It is one of the cheaper timing circuits out there, and it was recently updated and the new version looks awesome.

What the Camera Axe does is detect the BB as it leaves the gun using <a href=""http://www.glacialwanderer.com/hobbyrobotics/?p=446"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">this</a> sensor.  I actually built my own specifically for my BB gun.  What happens is the BB breaks the IR beam of the first pair of sensors, and then the second pair.  The Camera Axe then calculates how fast the BB is traveling, and will delay the firing of the flashes till it has traveled the specified distance.

Once it has, the flashes are fired by the Camera Axe using some <a href=""http://www.gadgetinfinity.com/product.php?productid=17204&amp;cat=0&amp;page=1"" rel=""noreferrer nofollow"">Cactus Wireless Flash Triggers</a>. then the shutter closes and the exposure is complete.

Also, the Camera Axe can do so much more then what I described, check out the web site to see all that it can do!

I did shoot a series of exposures with thoughts of blending in post, but nothing really worked out.   I even tried HDR and all the detail of light and dark even confounded Phomatix and CS5.   In the end I realized that this view really does show the scene pretty much as the eye sees it.    Sometimes blow outs have their place and eliminating them can make a seen look unreal.

I want to apologize the lack of photos in the 
last three days, but it was all for a good 
reason, in fact, a wonderful reason. As you 
all know, I'm a Visual Education teacher, 
but unfortunately I stayed home unemployed 
for almost nine months until I was called 
about two months ago to teach Dramatic 
Expression to 5-10 years old kids. It is not 
my educational field, but it's something that 
I also like to do. Last Thursday, I received 
a phone call from a school where I have 
teach three years ago and that is located 2 
Km from my house, asking me if I want 
to work with them. I'm used to make at 
least 150 Km everyday to the other schools 
where I teach. The best part is that they 
gave me the best schedule with the 
maximum hours possible to teach. And I 
can still teach Dramatic Expression in the 
other schools. It's very rare to happen 
something like this to a teacher that's 
starting his professional career. I could not 
believe that luck did finally found me. This 
is what all teachers in Portugal want. I'm 
a person that don't believe in luck, but 
I'm ready to change my mind, at least 
for the next four months. All this to say 
that it was impossible to edit and post 
new photos in the last days, because the 
preparation and all the paperwork necessary 
to begin teaching, was time consuming. 
I'll do my best to post regularly.

...................................

Quero desde já pedir desculpas pela falta
de fotos nos últimos três dias, mas foi
tudo por uma boa razão, aliás, uma excelente
razão. Como sabem, sou professor de
Educação Visual e Tecnológica, mas 
infelizmente, estive em casa desempregado
durante nove meses até que me chamaram
para dar aulas de Expressão Dramática no 1º 
Ciclo a crianças entre os 5 e os 10 anos de 
idade. Não é a minha área educacional, mas
é algo que eu gosto de fazer. Na quinta-feira
passada, recebi um telefonema de uma 
escola onde leccionei há três anos atrás e 
que se situa a cerca de 2 Km da minha 
casa, perguntando-me se estava interessado 
em dar aulas lá. Logicamente que aceitei.
Estava habituado a fazer pelo menos 150 Km
todos os dias para as outras escolas onde
leccionei. A melhor parte é que é um
horário completo e mesmo assim, posso
continuar a leccionar Expressão Dramática.
É muito raro acontecer algo semelhante a 
um professor no início da sua carreira 
profissional. Não acredito que a sorte 
encontrou-me finalmente. Isto é o que 
todos os professores portugueses querem.
Não acredito na sorte, mas estou disposto
a mudar de ideia, pelo menos durante os 
próximos quatro meses. Tudo isto para 
dizer que foi impossível editar e colocar
fotos novas nos últimos dias, porque
a papelada burocrática necessária para se 
começar a leccionar, ocupou todo o meu 
tempo. De qualquer forma, farei o meu

This was just a shot we didn't use from the Umbrella Birds photoshoot a couple weeks ago. I wanted to throw a brick wall in front of her so it looked like she was flying into the wall.

Strobist Info:  B800 low and to camera left with shoot through, stobe on right with shoot through umbrella. Taken against a blue background, then lightroom and photoshop for the rest.

In the Lancashire Cotton Mills it was the 'Tackler's' job to keep everything running in the mill at its optimum, and so would keep the looms running at all costs.  Here is a typical work station.  
If the mill owner arrived and found the Engineer ( who had the luxury of a small room slightly away from the noise of the looms) and the Tackler asleep at their desks he was more likely to be pleased than angry, because it meant that everything was running well!

I took this shot after going to an appointment to change my schedule for next school year.  Before the appointment, I was planning on finding a parking ramp that would allow me to find a great view, but due to having a limited amount of time, I just parked underground.  After the appointment, though, I found a much better ramp that had a great view.  It was worth the extra three dollars to find this interesting view! 

In case you were wondering, the parking garage I was shooting from belongs to the University of Minnesota.

Antigonish

As I was going up the stair I saw a man who wasn’t there
He wasn’t there again today
Oh, how I wish he’d go away...

When I came home last night at three The man was waiting there for me
But when I looked around the hall
I couldn’t see him there at all!
Go away, go away, don’t you come back any more!
Go away, go away, and please don’t slam the door... (slam!)

Last night I saw upon the stair A little man who wasn’t there
He wasn’t there again today
Oh, how I wish he’d go away

When that liquid rock called basalt is erupted onto the surface at Kilauea Volcano, Hawaii, it’s about 2,000 degrees Fahrenheit. That’s roughly the temperature of molten gold. Anything flammable in the path of such lava had better move aside, or expect to be burned. People at home in harm’s way almost always have adequate warning to safely flee, often with a car load or two of possessions. But a house is doomed, unless the owner has both the time and money to hire someone to put the house on wheels and haul it away."

If I had to pick one single moment in our last trip that I could somehow frame in my mind - this would be it. A day of being sodden in the rain walking the Routeburn could have resulted in moping, but the skies began to clear which eventually gave rise to this stunning sunset. Everyone else was back in the hut trying to get warm and really didn't know what they were missing out on! People often ask if the appearance is photoshopped - Well, I can tell you NOTHING I could do in post process would match what it was like to be there.  I'm going to be 100% stubborn here with the naysayers who may claim I'm lying - so yes, even though this has been edited, REALITY WAS BETTER!!!

The morning was misty and magical, just as I had imagined it would be. I completely lost myself as I wandered through the ancient walls which housed Emperors for over five centuries.

This shot was taken towards the early afternoon with the mist lifting up a bit. I saw this window create a perfect frame for my take on the Forbidden City – through a cage-like frame.

I watched my parent's TV in disbelief as the tragedy unfolded and the match was officially abandoned after just six minutes of play whilst the unofficial death toll continued to rise.

This shot was taken at Hillsborough, less than 24 hours after so many people had lost their lives in that same area. The biggest shame is that not one person has been held accountable for the tragedy. 

24,000 tickets, 23 turnstiles, two grossly overcrowded pens and 96 Liverpool supporters were crushed to death along with 766 people injured. Investigations found that too many gates were opened (allegedly ordered by the police) letting a large throng of fans to stream into an already full to capacity area which surrounded by anti hooligan fencing meant that no one could easily escape .

Taken during our free day back in Marrakech after the completion of the 2010 FOCUS Bike4Like in the halls of the souk Djemaa el Fna

I love the juxtaposition in the photograph of the new Morroco with the old Morocco. The crew who both led us during the biking portion of the <a href=""http://www.flickr.com/photos/almondbutterscotch/5332321800/"">Bike4Life Challenge</a> and took care of us during the camping portions mentioned time and time again how Morocco was changing due to urbanization, how most people in the rural areas don't understand how those in the city could call themselves Muslims when they drunk and party the way they do, and how those still in the outskirts worry about how the movement to the cities will affect their lives and livelihood.

Just before I took this photograph, I noticed the young girl (in a denim skirt no less) eyeing the scooter as her mother pulled her away from it only to be confronted by a man selling cheap handheld electronics.

A autumn view of Amelisweerd. A small but beautiful forest in the neighborhood of Utrecht (Bunnik).

In the eighties the forest has become smaller because of the  construction of a highway. There was a lot of protest and at last a trial against the state/province took place. While the trial was taking place and all the protesters were at the trial, the bulldozers and sawing machines removed the trees. A lovely example of our democratic state in Holland.

What remained is small but beautiful, although it is here never real quiet as being sandwiched between two highways and a railroad.

I went there to photograph a couple of mushrooms, but I didn't see any..... :(.

Thanks for watching.

Alas, it was not meant to be. So, today, as traffic slowed, I grabbed my camera from the center console, aimed it toward the Discovery Science Center Cube-type building, and took this picture. With a quick crop and some color adjustment, I'm stoked on the photo. This building must be 4 stories tall. It's pretty sweet.

Dzongri/Goechala(at the foot of Mt. Kanchendzonga) Trek - A small story of my life...The Story will continue for the next day.......

First let me say to you my friend, I am not a writer, I don't have good knowledge of English Literature,So if there are mistakes pardon me....

After planning of one month we have started Treak to Dzongri / Goechala from Yuksom, West Sikkim. First day we have taken permission from Kanchendzonga National Park Authority, Yuksom and then started approx 9:00AM. The Weather was cloudy in morning and it continued upto day end. We were 3 people and one guide- Bikram, one porter boy and 2 Yaks. It was approx. 12 day Trek to complete Goechala. As because the weather was not so good we stopped at Sachen at 2:30PM and started for preparing the Food.
In this capture one cottage is visible where we stayed at night, no window on that room, We used slipping Bags :-)

Story:
---------------------------------------------------------

The fog stretched from Half Moon Bay (my original destination) up to Pacifica. When it got too thick in Half Moon Bay, I headed north to the edge of the 5 mile wide fog bank. The edges of cloudy areas are where the best light is, so look out for it!

I usually like being right down on the beach when I shoot, but this higher than normal view shows off the glistening reflections of the sunset light. My usual 1/4-second exposure would soften the reflections and I wanted nearly-frozen detail for this one. This isn't about the motion of the closest wave but rather the texture of the water.

When you reach a destination, take a look around and see what you like best. Then go about capturing it. I had no intention of ending up at this pier but I headed for the light and this is what I saw. It is good to have a plan, but be ready to break it!

My most fvrt City.  The most  vibrant port city -having a coast line of 48kms-situated on the south-west coast of the Indian peninsula.It is surrounded by the Western Ghats on the east and the Arabian Sea on the west. It was from Kochi that the colonization of India started.It was/is an important spice trading centre. Now it is a significant commercial and industrial hub of India because of the IT boom. 
As a final note?
What makes this city beautiful..The people, the sea, Chinese fishing nets,multi culture, Jew street and kaikas biriyani (a famous shop which provides amazing biriyani),Mariane drive,cherai beach..and many more. For  me,what makes this city close to my heart is, my days with my friends here..The short train journeys to this city, window shoppings, those second hand book sellers in the street ( A street version of ebay) and those long walks with friends..


Update: I had given a border earlier defining the boundaries( pixel's/datas )in this frame but after traveling with ajay visual panoram&quot;s remarks about the frame above...yes i feel who am i to give  boundaries  for mother nature? We, the simple human being, always make this mistakes we define (or predefine) things, we try to define almost everything. We try to provide boundaries from ecology to emotions. We limit ourselves with well defined boundaries or self/ social imposed restrictions. Yes the process of elimination. When will we learn to think outside those boxes????
 I deleted the boundaries given earlier to the frame..now it is more than pixels it is a beautiful profile of mother nature. I am glad I am part of mother nature...

HISTORICAL INFORMATION

Situated in San Diego County on the Fort Rosecrans Military reservation, the cemetery is located approximately 10 miles west of San Diego, overlooking the bay and the city.

Many Fort Rosecrans interments date to the early years of the California Territory, including the remains of the casualties of the battle of San Pasqual. Shortly after the United States declared war on Mexico in May 1846, Brigadier Stephen Watts Kearney was tasked with conquering Mexico’s northern provinces, New Mexico and California. While Kearny demonstrated his considerable gift for administrative command with his acquisition of the New Mexican territory, he faced a more difficult task in California. Expecting a show of force from the Mexican Californios, Kearney set out west from New Mexico. Upon reaching California, Kit Carson intercepted him and his men, who informed him the territory had been taken by American settlers in the Bear Flag Revolt. Kearney sent 200 of his men back to New Mexico with the news and continued forward with one-third of his force. Unfortunately, the success of the revolt had been exaggerated and, before reaching their destination, Kearney and his men encountered a group of Californios intent on keeping more U.S. troops out of their homeland.

In the subsequent Battle of San Pasqual, 19 of Kearney’s men and an untold number of Californios lost their lives. Initially, the dead were buried where they fell, but by 1874 the remains had been removed to the San Diego Military Reservation. Eight years later, the bodies were again reinterred at what is now Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery. In 1922, the San Diego chapter of the Native Sons and Daughters of the Golden West had a large boulder brought from the battlefield and placed at the gravesite with a plaque affixed that lists the names of the dead.

Another notable monument in Fort Rosecrans National Cemetery commemorates the deaths of 62 sailors in a boiler explosion aboard the USS Bennington. The Bennington, which had just returned from maneuvers in the Pacific, was anchored in San Diego Harbor. On July 21, 1905, the crew was ordered to depart in search for the USS Wyoming, which had lost a propeller at sea. At approximately 10:30 a.m., an explosion in the boiler room ripped through the ship, killing and wounding the majority of the crew. Two days later the remains of soldiers and sailors were brought to the post cemetery and interred in an area known as Bennington Plot.

Fort Rosecrans became a National Cemetery on Oct. 5, 1934. The decision to make the post cemetery part of the national system came, in part, due to changes in legislation that greatly increased the number of persons eligible for burial in a national cemetery. Grave space in San Francisco National Cemetery then grew increasingly limited. In addition, southern California was experiencing a phenomenal population growth during this period, and there was a definitive need for more burial sites.

The world ain’t as half as bad
As they paint it to be
If all the sons
If all the daughters
Stopped to take it in
Well hopefully the hate subsides and the love can begin
It might start now..Yeahh
Well maybe I’m just dreaming out loud
Until then
Come home
Come home
Cause I’ve been waiting for you
For so long
For so long
And right now there's a war between the vanities
But all I see is you and me
The fight for you is all I’ve ever known
Ever known
So come home...

I finally got a chance to get out to Shenandoah National Park last evening and spend a most wonderful evening with Joey. We stopped at Subway to get a footlong to share and some yummy cookies while waiting to see what Mother Nature would bring us. We had dinner here at Gooney Run Overlook. 

The temperature was 55 with a ever so slight breeze, the bugs weren't as bad as I thought they might be, and even though the sunset wasn't a 'superb' one, it was none-the-less a most magical evening spent up at the park with my Son. 

I set up the tripod and was changing settings as the sun slowly crept behind the clouds and Joey was pushing the button on the remote cord. So this is a collaboration of him and I on this. ;-)

**Technical note: There apparently was some dust on my lens or sensor which the HDR processing really brought out. So if you look closely you will see some of it, and the hasteful attempt of me removing some. I was surprised by how much there was. Time to go check and clean my gear. "

El cementiri General de València va ser construït després de la decisió del govern de Carles III de prohibir els enterraments a les parròquies i nucli urbà, la qual cosa era la pràctica habitual a l'Espanya del segle XVIII i causava nombrosos problemes de salut.
El projecte, ideat per l'arquitecte Cristóbal de Sales, va començar el 1805. El seu disseny es va basar en la necròpolis francesa de Père Lachaise, un dels grans cementiris construïts en l'època i en el qual es va basar la construcció de nombrosos cementiris europeus.
El recinte es va inaugurar el 1807 amb un &quot;arrencada&quot; problemàtic, avui aquest cementiri té ja més de 200 llargs anys d'història.
Fins a mitjans del segle XIX els burgesos no començarien a interessar-se per construir panteons, ostentació del seu poder econòmic i classe social. És a dir, que l'encàrrec de panteons i criptes monumentals es posaria de moda bastant temps després de l'obertura del cementiri.
Per aquells anys, el Cementiri General de València va realitzar obres d'ampliació, ideant un vast projecte anomenat &quot;Els Pòrtics&quot;, d'estil neoclàssic i molt monumental. Prova d'això és que la construcció té 170 columnes dòriques.
En el Cementiri General de València es pot trobar una gran col lecció d'estils artístics com el neoegipci, el modernisme, el neogòtic o el neogrec, tots ells plasmats en impressionants escultures i dissenys que van enviar construir els burgesos valencians. Un dels més espectaculars és el panteó en honor a la filla adolescent de Gaspar Dotres, un temple d'estil clàssic preciós. A més dels panteons, és interessant fer una ullada al cementiri civil, on jeu l'escriptor Vicente Blasco Ibáñez, ia la secció musulmana a la qual el cementiri ha dedicat gairebé 700 hectàrees. Avui, el cementiri també compta amb unes instal.lacions de cremació.
A més de Blasco Ibáñez, el Cementiri General de València és l'eterna domicili d'altres il.lustres personatges com el cantant Nino Bravo, el pintor Joaquim Sorolla, la cantant d'òpera Lucrecia Bori ... I és que 200 anys d'història són molts per a un cementiri que tanca bona part de la història de la capital valenciana, per a una necròpolis que es troba entre les més monumentals d'Espanya i que no té res a envejar als més visitats cementiris europeus.
A partir de juny de 2009 el Cementiri General va posar en marxa una iniciativa pionera a la Comunitat Valenciana: visites guiades pel cementiri. D'aquesta manera, el recinte pretén mostrar el seu patrimoni artístic i arquitectònic. Així, el de València ingressa en el cèlebre Circuit Europeu de Cementiris.

---------------------------------------------------------------------- ------------------------------------------------

El cementerio General de Valencia fue construido tras la decisión del gobierno de Carlos III de prohibir los enterramientos en las parroquias y núcleo urbano, lo cual era la práctica habitual en la España del siglo XVIII y causaba numerosos problemas de salud.
El proyecto, ideado por el arquitecto Cristóbal de Sales, comenzó en 1805. Su diseño se basó en la necrópolis francesa de Père Lachaise, uno de los grandes cementerios construidos en la época y en el cual se basó la construcción de numerosos camposantos europeos.
El recinto se inauguró en 1807 con un &quot;arranque&quot; problemático, hoy este cementerio tiene ya más de 200 largos años de historia.
Hasta mediados del siglo XIX los burgueses no comenzarían a interesarse por construir panteones, ostentación de su poder económico y clase social. Es decir, que el encargo de panteones y criptas monumentales se pondría de moda bastante tiempo después de la apertura del cementerio.
Por aquellos años, el Cementerio General de Valencia realizó obras de ampliación, ideando un vasto proyecto llamado &quot;Los Pórticos&quot;, de estilo neoclásico y muy monumental. Prueba de ello es que la construcción cuenta con 170 columnas dóricas.
En el Cementerio General de Valencia se puede hallar una gran colección de estilos artísticos como el neoegipcio, el modernismo, el neogótico o el neogriego, todos ellos plasmados en impresionantes esculturas y diseños que mandaron construir los burgueses valencianos. Uno de los más espectaculares es el panteón en honor a la hija adolescente de Gaspar Dotres, un templo de estilo clásico precioso. Además de los panteones, es interesante echar un vistazo al cementerio civil, donde yace el escritor Vicente Blasco Ibáñez, y a la sección musulmana a la que el cementerio ha dedicado casi 700 hectáreas. Hoy, el cementerio también cuenta con unas instalaciones de cremación.
Además de Blasco Ibáñez, el Cementerio General de Valencia es la eterna morada de otros ilustres personajes como el cantante Nino Bravo, el pintor Joaquín Sorolla, la cantante de ópera Lucrecia Bori… Y es que 200 años de historia son muchos para un camposanto que encierra buena parte de la historia de la capital valenciana, para una necrópolis que se halla entre las más monumentales de España y que no tiene nada que envidiar a los más visitados camposantos europeos.
A partir de junio de 2009 el Cementerio General puso en marcha una iniciativa pionera en la Comunidad Valenciana: visitas guiadas por el camposanto. De esta manera, el recinto pretende mostrar su patrimonio artístico y arquitectónico. Así, el de Valencia ingresa en el célebre Circuito Europeo de Cementerios."

這是老家的閣樓。
樓下是老爸以前的中藥行。這裡以前是存放貨物的地方。

這裡充滿了童年的回憶。


小時候，我經常和童年玩伴到這個樓來玩耍。記得那時候的貨物很多，一堆一堆的。我們就各佔據點當“家”（以前都是這麽說的），然後開始在貨物堆中玩起來。

也有時候，老爸或老媽要找我們的時候，雖然沒幹什麽壞事，但是還是會覺得心虛，我們都會偷偷的跑到這裡來躲（，或者是感應到老媽要叫我去幹活）

This is the home's attic.
Downstairs is the father's chinese medicine store. This used to be for storage.

Here is full of childhood memories.


When I was a child, I often invite my childhood playmates to the floor to play. I remember that time there were still a lot of goods, piling everywhere.... or is it only because when I was small, everything seems big?!

We would each look for a comfortable spot and name it &quot;our home&quot;, then start playing within the heap of goods.

Sometimes also, my father or mother would look for us (shouting can be heard from downstairs), though we were not doing not do things bad, but still feel guilty, we would secretly try our best to hide. Or may be sub-consciously I was trying to hide because I could sense that my has some houseworks or tasks for me to do then! :-)

anyway, just to share what I have been through during those days...

It is really good to be at the same space, alone, and very quiet...

I can almost hear my heartbeat... and I can hear the sound I made each step I take on the old wooden platform....

memories just flow through my mind....


----- And now, after 3 years.   I was back on the same space... enjoying myself ... and taking pictures like before again, just that, this time, i was there with Fuji X100...

3561642062,"Alewives (<i>Alosa pseudoharengus</i>) are anadromous fish that spend the majority of their life at sea, but return to freshwater to spawn, entering rivers from early May to early June swimming upstream into lakes and ponds.  They are native to Maine rivers and at one time had a historical distribution throughout the Atlantic seaboard, from Newfoundland to Florida.  The seaward migration of young generally occurs from mid July through early November.

Alewives are important to the ecology of freshwater, estuarine, and marine environments. They provide an alternative prey item for osprey, eagles, great blue heron, loons and other fish eating birds. These fish tie our ocean, rivers and lakes together, providing vital nutrients and forage needed to make healthy watersheds. Between and within those various habitats, everything eats alewives: striped bass, bluefish, tuna, cod, haddock, halibut, American eel, brook trout, rainbow trout, brown trout, lake trout, landlocked salmon, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, pickerel, pike, white and yellow perch, seabirds, bald eagle, osprey, great blue heron, gulls, terns, cormorants, seals, whales, otter, mink, fox, raccoon, skunk, weasel, fisher, and turtles.

Adult alewives are preferred bait for the spring lobster fishery. There are 35 Maine municipalities that have commercial harvesting rights to alewives on 39 streams and rivers. These runs provide revenue to the towns, many of which lease their fishing privileges to independent fishermen. Many of the fishways built for alewife restoration on some of Maine's small coastal streams were partially funded by these municipalities because they recognized the value of this native fish species.

Alewives historically occurred in all major and minor coastal watersheds in Maine.  Declines in these populations were caused by the construction of dams and heavy industrial pollution, which rendered many waters unsuitable for their migration into freshwater spawning areas.  The Clean Water Act of the 1970's has helped re-establish a cleaner environment that now enables the restoration of alewives and other anadromous fish species to their historic habitats. Most recently, policies have garnered support for restoring anadromous fish species to their historical habitats through cooperative efforts (i.e., stocking, creating passageways at dams, and even dam removal).

And as my priority was to shoot Chehlum only these pictures of the Devils stump tree and the Shaitan Pool became a part of my spiritual travelogue too.

I shoot alone but the one photographer I get along well without stamping on his feet is Dr Glenn Losack MD .

We both are of a similar bent of mind , but I think he is more crazier than I am and fuck the crowds follow him too and in Mumbai he had a greater fan following than me and the Shias love him.
